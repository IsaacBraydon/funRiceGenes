NA	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	2016	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing POSTAL_CODE: 100101 China [CN].	Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are key endogenous regulators of plant growth. Previous work identified ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (EUI1) as a GA deactivating enzyme which plays an important role in panicle exsertion in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the mechanism that controls EUI1 activity during development is still largely unexplored. In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12. Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype. Quantification of GA levels in the uppermost internodes revealed that the HOX12 knockdown plants contain higher levels of the major biologically active GAs (such as GA1 and GA4) than these in the wild type. The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but lowered in HOX12 knockdown plants. Interestingly, both HOX12 and EUI1 genes are predominantly expressed in panicles, where GA4 is highly accumulated. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HOX12 physically interacts with EUI1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype. These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice.
NA	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	2018	PLoS One	College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&amp;F University, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.	The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family plays vital roles in plant development and morphogenesis as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In barley, a recessive mutation in Vrs1 (HvHox1) changes two-rowed barley to six-rowed barley, which improves yield considerably. The Vrs1 gene encodes an HD-Zip subfamily I transcription factor. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the rice HD-Zip I genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 are the closest homologues of Vrs1. Here, we show that Oshox12 and Oshox14 are ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in developing panicles. Trans-activation assays in yeast and rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox12 and Oshox14 can bind to a specific DNA sequence, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG), and activate reporter gene expression. Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype. In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion. Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development. This study provides a significant advancement in understanding the functions of HD-Zip transcription factors in rice.
NA	дк-Carotene Isomerase Suppresses Tillering in Rice through the Coordinated Biosynthesis of Strigolactone and Abscisic Acid	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Rice tillering is an important agronomic trait affecting grain yield. Here, we identified a high-tillering mutant tillering20 (t20), which could be restored to the wild type by treatment with the strigolactone (SL) analog rac-GR24. T20 encodes a chloroplast дк-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), which is involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids and their metabolites, SL and abscisic acid (ABA). The t20 mutant has reduced SL and ABA, raising the question of how SL and ABA biosynthesis is coordinated, and whether they have overlapping functions in tillering. We discovered that rac-GR24 stimulated T20 expression and enhanced all-trans-д┬-carotene biosynthesis. Importantly, rac-GR24 also stimulated expression of Oryza sativa 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 1 (OsNCED1) through induction of Oryza sativa HOMEOBOX12 (OsHOX12), promoting ABA biosynthesis in shoot base. On the other hand, ABA treatment significantly repressed SL biosynthesis and the ABA biosynthetic mutants displayed elevated SL biosynthesis. ABA treatment reduced the number of basal tillers in both t20 and wild-type plants. Furthermore, while ABA-deficient mutants aba1 and aba2 had the same number of basal tillers as wild type, they had more unproductive upper tillers at maturity. This work demonstrates complex interactions in the biosynthesis of carotenoid, SLs and ABA, and reveals a role for ABA in the regulation of rice tillering.
