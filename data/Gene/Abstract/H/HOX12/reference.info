NA	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	2016	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing POSTAL_CODE: 100101 China [CN].	Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) are key endogenous regulators of plant growth. Previous work identified ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 (EUI1) as a GA deactivating enzyme which plays an important role in panicle exsertion in rice (Oryza sativa). However, the mechanism that controls EUI1 activity during development is still largely unexplored. In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12. Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype. Quantification of GA levels in the uppermost internodes revealed that the HOX12 knockdown plants contain higher levels of the major biologically active GAs (such as GA1 and GA4) than these in the wild type. The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but lowered in HOX12 knockdown plants. Interestingly, both HOX12 and EUI1 genes are predominantly expressed in panicles, where GA4 is highly accumulated. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HOX12 physically interacts with EUI1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype. These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice.
NA	Functional analysis of the HD-Zip transcription factor genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice.	2018	PLoS One	College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&amp;F University, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.	The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) transcription factor family plays vital roles in plant development and morphogenesis as well as responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In barley, a recessive mutation in Vrs1 (HvHox1) changes two-rowed barley to six-rowed barley, which improves yield considerably. The Vrs1 gene encodes an HD-Zip subfamily I transcription factor. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the rice HD-Zip I genes Oshox12 and Oshox14 are the closest homologues of Vrs1. Here, we show that Oshox12 and Oshox14 are ubiquitously expressed with higher levels in developing panicles. Trans-activation assays in yeast and rice protoplasts demonstrated that Oshox12 and Oshox14 can bind to a specific DNA sequence, AH1 (CAAT(A/T)ATTG), and activate reporter gene expression. Overexpression of Oshox12 and Oshox14 in rice resulted in reduced panicle length and a dwarf phenotype. In addition, Oshox14 overexpression lines showed a deficiency in panicle exsertion. Our findings suggest that Oshox12 and Oshox14 may be involved in the regulation of panicle development. This study provides a significant advancement in understanding the functions of HD-Zip transcription factors in rice.
