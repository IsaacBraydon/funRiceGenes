HOX12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1. |  Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype |  The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but lowered in HOX12 knockdown plants |  Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype	 Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype
