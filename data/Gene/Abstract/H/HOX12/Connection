EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	In this study, we identified a dominant panicle enclosure mutant regulator of eui1 (ree1-D), which is caused by the activation of a homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor HOX12
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	Diminished HOX12 expression by RNA interference enhances the panicle exsertion, mimicking the eui1 phenotype
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	The expression of EUI1 is elevated in the ree1-D mutant but lowered in HOX12 knockdown plants
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	Interestingly, both HOX12 and EUI1 genes are predominantly expressed in panicles, where GA4 is highly accumulated
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that HOX12 physically interacts with EUI1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	Furthermore, overexpression of HOX12 in eui1 mutant background remains the elongated uppermost internode phenotype
EUI1|OsCYP714D1	HOX12|Oshox12	Rice HOX12 Regulates Panicle Exsertion by Directly Modulating the Expression of ELONGATED UPPERMOST INTERNODE1.	These results reveal a novel regulatory module that HOX12 acts directly through EUI1 to regulate panicle exsertion in rice
HOX12|Oshox12	OsNCED1|OsCCD4a	дк-Carotene Isomerase Suppresses Tillering in Rice through the Coordinated Biosynthesis of Strigolactone and Abscisic Acid	 Importantly, rac-GR24 also stimulated expression of Oryza sativa 9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 1 (OsNCED1) through induction of Oryza sativa HOMEOBOX12 (OsHOX12), promoting ABA biosynthesis in shoot base
HOX12|Oshox12	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	ipa1 improves rice drought tolerance at seedling stage mainly through activating abscisic acid pathway.	 In addition, based on yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay, IPA1 was found to directly activate the promoter activity of OsHOX12, a transcription factor promoting ABA biosynthesis, and OsNAC52, a positive regulator of the ABA pathway
HOX12|Oshox12	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	ipa1 improves rice drought tolerance at seedling stage mainly through activating abscisic acid pathway.	 The expression of OsHOX12 and OsNAC52 was significantly up-regulated in the ipa1 plants
