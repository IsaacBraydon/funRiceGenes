HPA1	leaf	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 In a further feeding assay with exogenous glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant that consumes H2O2, the H2O2 accumulation and leaf senescence phenotypes of hpa1 were obviously compensated
HPA1	leaf	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in hpa1 may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence
HPA1	leaf senescence	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 In a further feeding assay with exogenous glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant that consumes H2O2, the H2O2 accumulation and leaf senescence phenotypes of hpa1 were obviously compensated
HPA1	leaf senescence	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in hpa1 may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence
HPA1	senescence	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 In a further feeding assay with exogenous glutathione (GSH), a non-enzymatic antioxidant that consumes H2O2, the H2O2 accumulation and leaf senescence phenotypes of hpa1 were obviously compensated
HPA1	senescence	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in hpa1 may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence
HPA1	mitochondria	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Proteomics and enzyme activity analyses further revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation complex I and complex V were differentially expressed in hpa1, which was consistent with the H2O2 accumulation in hpa1
HPA1	map-based cloning	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Map-based cloning revealed that HPA1 encodes a tetrahydrofolate deformylase, and its deficiency led to the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate, 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate, in contrast, a decrease in 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate
HPA1	oxidative	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Proteomics and enzyme activity analyses further revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation complex I and complex V were differentially expressed in hpa1, which was consistent with the H2O2 accumulation in hpa1
HPA1	redox homeostasis	Formyl tetrahydrofolate deformylase affects hydrogen peroxide accumulation and leaf senescence by regulating the folate status and redox homeostasis in rice	 Taken together, our findings suggest that the accumulation of H2O2 in hpa1 may be mediated by an altered folate status and redox homeostasis, subsequently triggering leaf senescence
