10.1007-BF00191607.pdf	Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated	1994	Planta	Laboratorium voor Genetica, Universiteit Gent, K.L. Ledeganckstraat 35, B-9000, Gent, Belgium	We have characterized several heat-shock-induced genes in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and compared their expression under a variety of conditions. Three of these genes, which are analogs of the hsp82/90 family, lie within a cloned 18-kilobase (kb) region of the genome. The middle member of this cluster, designated hsp82B, has been fully sequenced. The gene uses a promoter containing six putative heat-shock elements as well as several unusual sequence motifs including a stretch of 11 thymidines alternating with 11 adenosines. The mRNA for this gene reaches its highest relative level of expression within 120 min after plants are shifted to 42Â° C; no other conditions induce this gene. By contrast, we found that during heat stress the expression of hsp70 correlates well with increases in internal ion concentrations, and can also be induced by excess salt or ethanol at normal growth temperatures. These results appear to indicate that whereas hsp70 is induced by all stresses that lead to protein denaturation â€<U+393C><U+3E34> including heat stress â€<U+393C><U+3E34> HSP82 mRNA accumulates only upon heat stress.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Plants can withstand many abiotic stresses. Stress adaptation through retention of imprints of previous stress exposure has also been described in plants. We have characterized the imprint or memory of adaptive stress responses of rice seedlings to arsenic (As) and heat stress. METHODOLOGY: Two-week-old rice seedlings (both with and without As) were given a 45 degrees C heat shock for 3 h. While under heat shock, the leafy portion of the seedlings was harvested at regular intervals. Subsequently, the seedlings were kept at room temperature for recovery and sampling continued over 3 h. Total RNA and protein were extracted from the leafy portion of the seedlings and complementary DNA (cDNA) was prepared from total RNA. The cDNA was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction to identify the transcription level of HSP70. Protein extracted from the seedlings was western-blotted. HSP70 and actin (loading control) antibodies were used to recognize the proteins on the same blot. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Our studies reveal that HSP70, a cellular chaperone gene, is over-expressed at the mRNA and protein levels when rice seedlings are exposed to As and heat. The effect is cumulative and increases with the duration of stress for 3 h. During 3 h recovery from heat stress at ambient temperatures for 3 h, the chaperone remains expressed at higher levels in plants pre-exposed to As. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a retention of the imprint of previous stress exposure, perhaps through sustained activation of the signalling pathways upstream of over-expression of HSP70. Furthermore, stress-induced HSP70 expression was additive/cumulative for continued exposure to similar or different kinds of stress, indicating that a commonality of signal transduction networks is adopted when plants experience more than one stress.
NA	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	2011	Planta	Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering Drug and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100875, People's Republic of China.	Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
