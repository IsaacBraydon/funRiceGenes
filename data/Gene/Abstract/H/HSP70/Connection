ELIP	HSP70	Overexpression of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene OsTPS1 enhances abiotic stress tolerance in rice.	In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP

HSP70	OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	 OsHsfA6a in-silico network was enriched in MAP kinases along with Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins
HSP70	OsERdj7	OsERdj7 is an ER-resident J-protein involved in ER quality control in rice endosperm.	OsERdj7 is one of six endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident J-domain-containing proteins (J-proteins) encoded by the rice genome that acts as a co-chaperone for Hsp70 and is characterized by the presence of two transmembrane domains
