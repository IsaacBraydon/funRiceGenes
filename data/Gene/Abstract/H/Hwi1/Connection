Hwi1	Hwi2	A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.	 Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperature-dependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice
Hwi1	Hwi2	A two-locus interaction causes interspecific hybrid weakness in rice.	 Functional analysis indicated that pyramiding of Hwi1 and Hwi2 activates the autoimmune response in the basal nodes of hybrids, interrupting root formation and then impairing shoot growth
