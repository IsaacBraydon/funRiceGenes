Hwi1	crown	Genetic and physiological analysis of a novel type of interspecific hybrid weakness in rice	The dominant Hybrid weakness i1 (Hwi1) gene from wild rice is genetically incompatible with Teqing and induced a set of weakness symptoms, including growth suppression, yield decrease, impaired nutrient absorption, and the retardation of crown root initiation
