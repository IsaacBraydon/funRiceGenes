IBF1	reproductive	A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows	Real-time RT-PCR and GUS activity assays revealed that IBF1 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues
IBF1	seed	A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows	In the ibf1 mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in hull furrows during seed maturation and reach a maximum level in dry seeds
