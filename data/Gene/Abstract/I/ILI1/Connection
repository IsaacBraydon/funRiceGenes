ILI1	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	OsBZR1|BZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest
ILI1	OsSLA1	OsSLA1 functions in leaf angle regulation by enhancing the interaction between OsBRI1 and OsBAK1 in rice.	 The OsSLA1 mutant plants were insensitive to exogenous epibrassinolide (eBL) and showed upregulated expression of DWARF and CPD, but downregulated expression of BU1, BUL1, and ILI1, indicating that brassinosteroid (BR) signal transduction was blocked
