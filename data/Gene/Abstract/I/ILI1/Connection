ILI1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	OsBZR1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
ILI1	LIC|OsLIC1	Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice	 Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	 ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	 Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	 BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1
ILI1	OsIBH1|IBH1	Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis	 The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest
