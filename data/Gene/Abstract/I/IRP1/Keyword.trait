IRP1	transcription factor	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 RNA-seq results revealed that 84% of genes upregulated by IRP1 peptide were also induced by a microbe-associated molecular pattern(MAMP) chitin, including 13 OsWRKY transcription factors, indicating that IRP1 and chitin share a similar signaling pathway
IRP1	resistance	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 Rice plants overexpressing IRP1 enhanced resistance to the virulent rice blast fungus
IRP1	defense	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 Application of IRP1 peptide to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of IRP1 itself and the defense gene PAL1
IRP1	blast	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 Rice plants overexpressing IRP1 enhanced resistance to the virulent rice blast fungus
IRP1	immunity	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 Here, we studied IRP1 functions in rice immunity
IRP1	immunity	The secreted peptide IRP1 functions as a phytocytokine in rice immunity.	 Collectively, our findings indicate that IRP1 functions as a phytocyokine in rice immunity regulating MAPKs and OsWRKYs that could amplify chitin and other signaling pathways, and provide new insights into how MAMPs and phytocyokines cooperatively regulate rice immunity
