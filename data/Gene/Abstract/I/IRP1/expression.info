Symbol	Expression
IRP1	 Application of IRP1 peptide to rice suspension cells triggered the expression of IRP1 itself and the defense gene PAL1 |  Co-treatment with chitin and IRP1 elevated the expression level of PAL1 and OsWRKYs in an additive manner |  The increased chitin concentration arrested the induction of IRP1 and PAL1 expressions by IRP1, but cannot affect IRP1-triggered MAPK activation
