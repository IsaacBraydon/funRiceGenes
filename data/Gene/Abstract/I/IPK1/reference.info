Phytic acid (InsP(6)) is considered to be the major source of phosphorus and inositol phosphates in most cereal grains. However, InsP(6) is not utilized efficiently by monogastric animals due to lack of phytase enzyme. Furthermore, due to its ability to chelate mineral cations, phytic acid is considered to be an antinutrient that renders these minerals unavailable for absorption. In view of these facts, reducing the phytic acid content in cereal grains is a desired goal for the genetic improvement of several crops. In the present study, we report the RNAi-mediated seed-specific silencing (using the Oleosin18 promoter) of the IPK1 gene, which catalyzes the last step of phytic acid biosynthesis in rice. The presence of the transgene cassette in the resulting transgenic plants was confirmed by molecular analysis, indicating the stable integration of the transgene. The subsequent T4 transgenic seeds revealed 3.85-fold down-regulation in IPK1 transcripts, which correlated to a significant reduction in phytate levels and a concomitant increase in the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi). The low-phytate rice seeds also accumulated 1.8-fold more iron in the endosperm due to the decreased phytic acid levels. No negative effects were observed on seed germination or in any of the agronomic traits examined. The results provide evidence that silencing of IPK1 gene can mediate a substantial reduction in seed phytate levels without hampering the growth and development of transgenic rice plants.
NA	An Inositol 1, 3, 4, 5, 6-Pentakisphosphate 2-Kinase 1 Mutant with a 33-nt Deletion Showed Enhanced Tolerance to Salt and Drought Stress in Rice	2020	Plants (Basel)	National Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Institute of Crop Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	OsIPK1 encodes inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, which catalyzes the conversion of myo-inositol-1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate to myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6) in rice. By clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9)-mediated mutagenesis in the 3rd exon of the gene, three OsIPK1 mutations, i.e., osipk1_1 (a 33-nt deletion), osipk1_2 (a 1-nt deletion), and osipk1_3 (a 2-nt deletion) were identified in T0 plants of the rice line Xidao #1 (wild type, WT). A transfer DNA free line with the homozygous osipk1_1 mutation was developed; however, no homozygous mutant lines could be developed for the other two mutations. The comparative assay showed that the osipk1_1 mutant line had a significantly lower level of phytic acid (PA, IP6; -19.5%) in rice grain and agronomic traits comparable to the WT. However, the osipk1_1 mutant was more tolerant to salt and drought stresses than the WT, with significantly lower levels of inositol triphosphate (IP3), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced IP6, and higher activities of antioxidant enzymes in seedlings subjected to these stresses. Further analyses showed that the transcription of stress response genes was significantly upregulated in the osipk1_1 mutant under stress. Thus, the low phytic acid mutant osipk1_1 should have potential applications in rice breeding and production.
