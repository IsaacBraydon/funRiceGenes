ILA1	vascular bundle	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice	 The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants| ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints
ILA1	leaf	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice	 We report here the characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, increased leaf angle1 (ila1), resulting from a T-DNA insertion in a Group C MAPKKK gene| The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants| ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints| Microarray analyses of leaf lamina joints provided additional evidence for alterations in mechanical strength in ila1| ILA1 is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint
ILA1	lamina	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice	 The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants| ILA1 is predominantly resident in the nucleus and expressed in the vascular bundles of leaf lamina joints| Microarray analyses of leaf lamina joints provided additional evidence for alterations in mechanical strength in ila1| ILA1 is thus a key factor regulating mechanical tissue formation at the leaf lamina joint
ILA1	cell wall	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice	 The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants
ILA1	brassinosteroid	Increased leaf angle1, a Raf-like MAPKKK that interacts with a nuclear protein family, regulates mechanical tissue formation in the Lamina joint of rice	 The increased leaf angle in ila1 is caused by abnormal vascular bundle formation and cell wall composition in the leaf lamina joint, as distinct from the mechanism observed in brassinosteroid-related mutants
