IAA6|OsIAA6	OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.	A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
