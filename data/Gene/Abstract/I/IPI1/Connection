IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 Here, we report the identification and characterization of IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (IPI1), a RING-finger E3 ligase that can interact with IPA1 in the nucleus
IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 IPI1 promotes the degradation of IPA1 in panicles while it stabilizes IPA1 in shoot apexes
IPI1	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	Tissue-specific Ubiquitination by IPA1 INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 Modulates IPA1 Protein Levels to Regulate Plant Architecture in Rice.	 These results demonstrate that IPI1 affects plant architecture through precisely tuning IPA1 protein levels in different tissues in rice, and provide new insight into the tissue-specific regulation of plant architecture and important genetic resources for molecular breeding applications
