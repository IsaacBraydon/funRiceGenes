IDEF2	OsYSL2	A novel NAC transcription factor, IDEF2, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants	 Several genes up-regulated by iron deficiency, including the Fe(II)-nicotianamine transporter gene OsYSL2, were less induced by iron deficiency in the RNAi rice of IDEF2, suggesting that IDEF2 is involved in the regulation of these genes
IDEF2	OsYSL2	A novel NAC transcription factor, IDEF2, that recognizes the iron deficiency-responsive element 2 regulates the genes involved in iron homeostasis in plants	 IDEF2 bound to OsYSL2 promoter region containing the binding core site, suggesting direct regulation of OsYSL2 expression
IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 The iron deficiency-responsive cis-acting element binding factors 1 and 2 (IDEF1 and IDEF2) regulate transcriptional response to iron deficiency in rice roots
IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 Clarification of the functions of IDEF1 and IDEF2 could uncover the gene regulation mechanism
IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 METHODS: Spatial patterns of IDEF1 and IDEF2 expression were analysed by histochemical staining of IDEF1 and IDEF2 promoter-GUS transgenic rice lines
IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 Expression patterns of the target genes of IDEF1 and IDEF2 were analysed using transformants with induced or repressed expression of IDEF1 or IDEF2 grown in iron-rich or in iron-deficient solutions for 1 d

IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 The spatial expression patterns of IDEF1 and IDEF2 overlap with their target genes in restricted cell types, but not in all cells
IDEF1	IDEF2	The spatial expression and regulation of transcription factors IDEF1 and IDEF2	 The spatial expression patterns and gene regulation of IDEF1 and IDEF2 in roots are generally conserved under conditions of iron sufficiency and deficiency, suggesting complicated interactions with unknown factors for sensing and transmitting iron-deficiency signals
