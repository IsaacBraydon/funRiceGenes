Debranching enzymes, which hydrolyze alpha-1 and 6-glucosidic linkages in alpha-polyglucans, play a dual role in the synthesis and degradation of starch in plants. A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night. An epitope-tagged ISA3 expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited hydrolytic activity on beta-limit dextrin and amylopectin. We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm. ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm. Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant. Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules. Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic. These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice.
NA	Co-Overexpression of Two Key Source Genes, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, Improves Multiple Key Traits of Rice Seeds.	2022	J Agric Food Chem	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding/Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu 225009, China.	Optimized source-sink interactions are determinants of both rice yield and quality. However, most source genes have not been well studied in rice, a major grain crop. In this study, OsBMY4 and OsISA3, the key β-amylase and debranching enzymes that control transient starch degradation in rice leaves, were co-overexpressed in rice in order to accelerate starch degradation efficiency and increase the sugar supply for sink organs. Systematic analyses of the transgenic rice indicated that co-overexpression of OsBMY4 and OsISA3 not only promoted rice yield and quality, but also improved seed germination and stress tolerance. Moreover, since the OsBMY4 gene has not been characterized, we generated osbmy4 mutants using CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing, which helped to reveal the roles of β-amylase in rice yield and quality. This study demonstrated that specific modulation of the expression of some key source genes improves the source-sink balance and leads to improvements in multiple key traits of rice seeds.
