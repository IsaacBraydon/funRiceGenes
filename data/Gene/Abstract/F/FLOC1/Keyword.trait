FLOC1	seed	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 These findings suggest that FLOC1 is involved not only in seed fertility but also in seed quality
FLOC1	seed	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and FLOC1 although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation
FLOC1	fertility	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 A knock-down transformant of FLOC1 showed significantly reducted fertility and generation of seeds with abnormal features
FLOC1	fertility	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 These findings suggest that FLOC1 is involved not only in seed fertility but also in seed quality
FLOC1	quality	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 These findings suggest that FLOC1 is involved not only in seed fertility but also in seed quality
