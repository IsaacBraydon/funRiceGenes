FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 A protein, which we named FLOC1, interacted with FLO2
FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and FLOC1 although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation
