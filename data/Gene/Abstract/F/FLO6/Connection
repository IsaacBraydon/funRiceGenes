FLO6	OsHSP60-3B	Rice HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN60-3B maintains male fertility under high temperature by starch granule biogenesis.	 Western-blot results showed that FLO6 level was substantially decreased in oshsp60-3b anthers at high temperature, indicating that OsHSP60-3B is required to stabilize FLO6 when temperatures exceed optimal conditions
FLO6	OsHSP60-3B	Rice HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN60-3B maintains male fertility under high temperature by starch granule biogenesis.	 We suggest that in response to high temperature, OsHSP60-3B interacts with FLO6 to regulate starch granule biogenesis in rice pollen and attenuates ROS levels in anthers to ensure normal male gametophyte development in rice
