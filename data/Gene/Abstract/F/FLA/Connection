FLA	OsFLA2	An Analysis of Natural Variation Reveals That OsFLA2 Controls Flag Leaf Angle in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 We also confirmed that the allele OsFLA2 (TT) increased the FLA compared with that of the isogenic line carrying allele OsFLA2 (CC) by transgenic complementation experiment
FLA	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC|OsFLA6	An Analysis of Natural Variation Reveals That OsFLA2 Controls Flag Leaf Angle in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 We identified two causal gene loci for FLA, namely, OsFLA6 and OsFLA2; OsFLA6 was co-localized with the gene OsLIC
FLA	LIC|OsLIC1|OsLIC|OsFLA6	An Analysis of Natural Variation Reveals That OsFLA2 Controls Flag Leaf Angle in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In addition, the accessions with large and small FLA values have corresponding high and low OsFLA6 expressions
