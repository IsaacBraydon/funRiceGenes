FLO18	development	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM 18 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for 5&#39; processing of mitochondrial nad5 messenger RNA and endosperm development.	 These results suggested that FLO18 is involved in 5&#39;-end processing of nad5 messenger RNA and plays an important role in mitochondrial function and endosperm development
FLO18	map-based cloning	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM 18 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for 5&#39; processing of mitochondrial nad5 messenger RNA and endosperm development.	 Map-based cloning and complementation tests showed that FLO18 encodes a mitochondrion-targeted P-type PPR protein with 15 PPR motifs
FLO18	R protein	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM 18 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for 5&#39; processing of mitochondrial nad5 messenger RNA and endosperm development.	 Map-based cloning and complementation tests showed that FLO18 encodes a mitochondrion-targeted P-type PPR protein with 15 PPR motifs
