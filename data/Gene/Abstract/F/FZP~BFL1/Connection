FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
