FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMADS6|MFO1|AFG1	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMADS7|OsMADS45	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)

FZP overexpression positively regulates the expression of a subset of the class B genes, AGL6 genes (OsMADS6 and OsMADS17) as well as class E genes (OsMADS1, OsMADS7 and OsMADS8) in floral meristem (FM)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	RFL|APO2|SSC	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FRIZZLE PANICLE (FZP) and RFL/ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) play important roles in regulating the ABCDE floral organ identity genes
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsBZR1	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 The transcription repressor OsBZR1 binds the CGTG motifs in CNV-18bp and thereby represses FZP expression, indicating that CNV-18bp is the upstream silencer of FZP
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 The CNV-18bp duplication repressed FZP expression, prolonged the panicle branching period and increased grain yield by more than 15% through substantially increasing the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) and slightly decreasing the 1,000-grain weight (TGW)
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	SPP	Duplication of an upstream silencer of FZP increases grain yield in rice.	 These findings showed that the silencer CNVs coordinate a trade-off between SPP and TGW by fine-tuning FZP expression, and balancing the trade-off could enhance yield potential
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like serine and cysteine protease, interacted with FZP and promoted FZP degradation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Consistently, down-regulating FZP expression or up-regulating NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	OsMFT1	OsMFT1 increases spikelets per panicle and delays heading date in rice by suppressing Ehd1, FZP and SEPALLATA-like genes.	 RNA-seq and RNA in situ hybridization analysis confirmed that OsMFT1 repressed expression of FZP and five SEPALLATA-like genes, indicating that the transition from branch meristem to spikelet meristem was delayed and thus more panicle branches were produced
