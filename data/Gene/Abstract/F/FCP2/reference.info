CLAVATA3 (CLV3)/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-related (CLE) proteins belong to a small peptide family conserved in plants. Recent studies in Arabidopsis and rice have revealed a key role for CLEs in mediating cell-cell communication and stem cell maintenance during plant development, but how CLE signalling controls root development in the rice remains largely unknown. Here it is shown that exogenous application of a synthetic dodeca-amino acid peptide corresponding to the CLE motif of the rice FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN2 (FCP2p) protein or overexpression of FCP2 terminates root apical meristem (RAM) activity and impairs late metaxylem formation. FCP2p treatment suppresses the expression of the rice QUIESCENT-CENTER-SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX (QHB) gene, a putative orthologue of Arabidopsis WUSCHEL (WUS)-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) gene, in both quiescent centre and late metaxylem cells; whereas inducible overexpression of QHB reduces the sensitivity of rice to FCP2p treatment. These results together suggest that in rice RAM maintenance and late metaxylem development are probably controlled by the mutual regulation between FCP2 and QHB. Moreover, a cross-species peptide treatment experiment in Arabidopsis implies that FCP2 has both evolutionarily conserved and species-specific roles in root development.
Plant Cell-2013-Ohmori-229-41.pdf	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	2013	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan.	The shoot apical meristem is the ultimate source of the cells that constitute the entire aboveground portion of the plant body. In Arabidopsis thaliana, meristem maintenance is regulated by the negative feedback loop of WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV). Although CLV-like genes, such as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1) and FON2, have been shown to be involved in maintenance of the reproductive meristems in rice (Oryza sativa), current understanding of meristem maintenance remains insufficient. In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase. In addition, we found that WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) promotes the undifferentiated state of the meristem in rice and that WOX4 function is associated with cytokinin action. Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2). Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice.
