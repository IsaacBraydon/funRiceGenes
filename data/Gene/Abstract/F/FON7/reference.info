Floral organ number is crucial for successful seed setting and mature grain development. Although some genes and signaling pathways controlling floral organ number have been studied, the underlying mechanism is complicated and requires further investigation. In this study, a floral organ number mutant was generated by the ethyl methanesulfonate treatment of the Korean japonica rice cultivar Ilpum. In the floral organ number mutant, 37% of the spikelets showed an increase in the number of floral organs, especially stamens and pistils. Histological analysis revealed that the number of ovaries was determined by the number of stigmas; spikelets with two or three stigmas contained only one ovary, whereas spikelets with four stigmas possessed two ovaries. The floral organ number mutant showed pleiotropic phenotypes including multiple grains, early flowering, short plant height, and reduced tiller number compared with the wild-type. Genetic and MutMap analyses revealed that floral organ number is controlled by a single recessive gene located between the 8.0 and 20.0 Mb region on chromosome 8. Calculation of SNP-index confirmed Os08g0299000 as the candidate gene regulating floral organ number, which was designated as FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER7 (FON7). A single nucleotide polymorphism (G to A) was discovered at the intron splicing donor site of FON7, which caused the skipping of the entire sixth exon in the mutant, resulting in the deletion of 144 bp. Furthermore, the T-DNA-tagged line displayed the same floral organ number phenotype as the fon7 mutant. These results provide valuable insight into the mechanism of floral organ differentiation and formation in rice.
