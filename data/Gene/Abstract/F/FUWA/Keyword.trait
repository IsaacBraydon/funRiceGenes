FUWA	shoot	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 FUWA encodes a NHL domain containing protein, with a preferential expression in meristems of root, shoot apical and inflorescence, where it restricts excessive cell division
FUWA	panicle	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation
FUWA	panicle	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds
FUWA	grain	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation
FUWA	grain	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds
FUWA	domestication	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Sequence analysis revealed that FUWA has undergone a bottleneck effect and become fixed in landraces and modern cultivars during domestication and breeding
FUWA	development	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation
FUWA	grain size	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds
FUWA	cell division	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 FUWA encodes a NHL domain containing protein, with a preferential expression in meristems of root, shoot apical and inflorescence, where it restricts excessive cell division
FUWA	architecture	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation
FUWA	erect	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds
FUWA	breeding	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	 Sequence analysis revealed that FUWA has undergone a bottleneck effect and become fixed in landraces and modern cultivars during domestication and breeding
