NA	An evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, plays a role in determining panicle architecture, grain shape and weight in rice.	2015	Plant J	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 100081, Beijing, China.	Plant breeding relies on creation of novel allelic combinations for desired traits. Identification and utilization of beneficial alleles, rare alleles and evolutionarily conserved genes in the germplasm (and thus could be called &quot;hidden&quot; genes) provide an effective approach to achieve this goal. Here we show that a chemical induced null mutation in an evolutionarily conserved gene, FUWA, alters multiple important agronomic traits in rice, including panicle architecture, grain shape and weight. FUWA encodes a NHL domain containing protein, with a preferential expression in meristems of root, shoot apical and inflorescence, where it restricts excessive cell division. Sequence analysis revealed that FUWA has undergone a bottleneck effect and become fixed in landraces and modern cultivars during domestication and breeding. We further confirm a highly conserved role of FUWA homologues in determining panicle architecture and grain development in rice, maize and sorghum through genetic transformation. Strikingly, knocking-down FUWA transcription level by RNA interference leads to an erect panicle and an increased grain size in both indica and japonica genetic backgrounds. This study illustrates an approach of creating new germplasm with improved agronomic traits for crop breeding through tapping into evolutionary conserved genes.
