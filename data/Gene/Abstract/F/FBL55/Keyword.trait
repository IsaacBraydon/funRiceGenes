FBL55	auxin	Rice siR109944 suppresses plant immunity to sheath blight and impacts multiple agronomic traits by affecting auxin homeostasis.	 Auxin metabolism- and signaling pathway-related genes were differentially expressed in the siR109944 OE and FBL55 OE plants
FBL55	resistance	Rice siR109944 suppresses plant immunity to sheath blight and impacts multiple agronomic traits by affecting auxin homeostasis.	 We found that rice had significantly enhanced susceptibility when siR109944 was overexpressed, while FBL55 OE plants showed resistance to R
