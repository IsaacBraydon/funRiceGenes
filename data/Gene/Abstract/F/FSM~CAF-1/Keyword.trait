FSM|CAF-1	vegetative	The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period	We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
FSM|CAF-1	seedling	The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period	We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
FSM|CAF-1	growth	The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period	We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
FSM|CAF-1	shoot	The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period	We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase| Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
