FLO2	OsAPS2|OsAGPS2b	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsBEIIb|OsSBEIIb	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsISA1|OsPHS8	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsPUL	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 A protein, which we named FLOC1, interacted with FLO2
FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and FLOC1 although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation
FLO2	OsLEA5	Overexpression of rice OsLEA5 relieves the deterioration in seed quality caused by high-temperature stress.	 OsLEA5 (Lea14A) interacts with a regulator of the endosperm storage production, FLO2, suggesting that OsLEA5 may be involved in endosperm quality control
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Here, FLO2 interaction factor 3 (OsFIF3), a bHLH transcription factor, was identified and analyzed in Oryza sativa
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 The DAP-seq (DNA affinity purification sequencing) results showed that OsFIF3 could affect the transcriptional accumulation of β-amylase 1, α-amylase isozyme 2A-like, pectinesterase 11, β-glucosidase 28 like, pectinesterase, sucrose transport protein 1 (SUT1), and FLO2 through the binding of the CACGTG motif on their promoters
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Moreover, FLO2 and SUT1 with abundant OsFIF3 binding signals showed significant expression reduction in OsFIF3 overexpression lines, further confirming OsFIF3&#x27;s role in starch metabolism regulation and energy material allocation
FLO2	OsFIF3	Regulation of Grain Chalkiness and Starch Metabolism by FLO2 Interaction Factor 3, a bHLH Transcription Factor in Oryza sativa.	 Taken together, these findings show that the overexpression of OsFIF3 inhibits the expression of FLO2 and SUT1, thereby increasing grain chalkiness and affecting grain weight
