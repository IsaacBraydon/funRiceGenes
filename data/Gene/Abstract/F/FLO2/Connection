FLO2	OsAPS2|OsAGPS2b	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsBEIIb|OsSBEIIb	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsISA1|OsPHS8	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	OsPUL	Three novel alleles of FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2) confer dull grains with low amylose content in rice.	The allelic diversity of flo2 perturbed the expression of starch synthesis-related genes including OsAGPL2, OsAGPS2b, OsGBSSI, OsBEI, OsBEIIb, OsISA1, and OsPUL
FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 A protein, which we named FLOC1, interacted with FLO2
FLO2	FLOC1	A novel FLOURY ENDOSPERM2 (FLO2)-interacting protein, is involved in maintaining fertility and seed quality in rice.	 these findings imply that there is a difference in the functions of FLO2 and FLOC1 although both of appear to be involved in the control of seed quality during seed formation
FLO2	OsLEA5	Overexpression of rice OsLEA5 relieves the deterioration in seed quality caused by high-temperature stress.	 OsLEA5 (Lea14A) interacts with a regulator of the endosperm storage production, FLO2, suggesting that OsLEA5 may be involved in endosperm quality control
