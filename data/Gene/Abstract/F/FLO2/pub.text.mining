kD), major allergenic protein genes (14 to 16 kD; RA16, RA17,                  candidate genes, Os04g0645100, while no mutation was found    We next set out to determine whether there was also an                      a complete wild-type copy of the Os04g0645100 gene. These                                                                                flo2 mutation. Consequently, we identified the Os04g0645100                                                                               genes, designated FLO2-LIKE1 (FLL1) (Os02g0255700) and                                                                               FLL2 (Os07g0422000).
