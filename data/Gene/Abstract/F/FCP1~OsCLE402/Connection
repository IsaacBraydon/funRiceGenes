FCP1|OsCLE402	FON1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2
FCP1|OsCLE402	FCP2	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase
FCP1|OsCLE402	FCP2	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
FCP1|OsCLE402	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
FCP1|OsCLE402	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice
FCP1|OsCLE402	OsPNH1	Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice leaf development.	By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression
DL	FCP1|OsCLE402	Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice  leaf development	Spatial expression patterns of developmental genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsPINHEAD1 (OsPNH1) were severely affected in the FCP1-overexpressing shoots
