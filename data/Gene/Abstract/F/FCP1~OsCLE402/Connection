FCP1|OsCLE402	FON1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	 FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	 Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)| Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM| FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions| Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2
FCP1|OsCLE402	FCP2	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	 In this article, we demonstrate that the FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1) and FCP2 genes encoding proteins with similar CLE domains are involved in negative regulation of meristem maintenance in the vegetative phase| Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
FCP1|OsCLE402	OsWOX4	WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice	 Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)| Thus, FCP1/2 and WOX4 are likely to be involved in maintenance of the vegetative meristem in rice
