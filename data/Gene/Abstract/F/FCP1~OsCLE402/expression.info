FCP1|OsCLE402	 We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath |  Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression |  Spatial expression patterns of developmental genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsPINHEAD1 (OsPNH1) were severely affected in the FCP1-overexpressing shoots |  Whereas DL was expressed in the central region of leaf primordia in control shoots, DL expression was expanded throughout the leaf primordia of the FCP1-overexpressing shoots in early developmental stages |  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression	 We found that overexpression of FCP1 affects various aspects of leaf development in shoots regenerated from calli, making it difficult to distinguish between the leaf blade and leaf sheath |  Differentiation of tissues such as vascular bundle and sclerenchyma was strongly inhibited by FCP1 overexpression |  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression
