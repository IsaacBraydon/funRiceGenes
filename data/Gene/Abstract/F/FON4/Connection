FON2|FON4|TG1	FOS1	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice	Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways
FON2|FON4|TG1	FOS1	FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice	Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa)
FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM

FCP1|OsCLE402	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2
FON1	FON2|FON4|TG1	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
FON1	FON2|FON4|TG1	The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice	FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation
FON2|FON4|TG1	OSMADS3	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	 Disruption of OsMADS3 in the fon2 mutant by CRISPR-Cas9 technology caused a flower phenotype similar to that of 2B-424, confirming that the gene responsible for enhancement of fon2 was OsMADS3
FON2|FON4|TG1	OSMADS3	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	 Morphological analysis showed that the fon2 and osmads3 mutations synergistically affected pistil development and FM determinacy
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory network and genetic interactions established by OsMADS34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet morphogenesis.	 Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads34 lax1 and osmads34 fon4 compared with the single mutants
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsPID	OsPINOID Regulates Stigma and Ovule Initiation through Maintenance of the Floral Meristem by Auxin Signaling.	 Moreover, the transcription of the floral meristem marker gene, OSH1, was down-regulated and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), the putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was up-regulated in the pistil primordium of ospid
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 In this study, through genetic enhancer analysis, we found that loss of function of ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1), encoding an Arabidopsis TOPLESS (TPL)-like transcriptional corepressor, enhances the fon2 flower phenotype, which displayed an increase in floral organ number
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 In the fon2 asp1 double mutant, the inflorescence was severely affected, resulting in bifurcation of the main axis (rachis), a phenotype that has not previously been reported
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 The stem cells showed marked overproliferation in fon2 asp1, resulting in extreme enlargement and splitting of the inflorescence meristem
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 These results suggest that ASP1 and FON2 synergistically regulate stem cell maintenance in rice
FON2|FON4|TG1	OsTPL|ASP1|OsLIS-L1	Transcriptional corepressor ASP1 and CLV-like signaling regulate meristem maintenance in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest that TPL-like corepressor activity plays a crucial role in meristem maintenance, and that stem cell proliferation is properly maintained via the cooperation of ASP1 and FON2
FON2|FON4|TG1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 Recently, we showed that a double mutant of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the TAB1 function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem
FON2|FON4|TG1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	 In this paper, we confirmed that TAB1 is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants
FON2|FON4|TG1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	 To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)
FON2|FON4|TG1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	 By contrast, the stem cell region and TAB1 expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation
FON2|FON4|TG1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	 These results indicate that TAB1 is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting TAB1 expression
