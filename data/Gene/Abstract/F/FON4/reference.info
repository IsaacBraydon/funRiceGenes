CLAVATA signaling restricts stem cell identity in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis thaliana. In rice (Oryza sativa), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), closely related to CLV3, is involved as a signaling molecule in a similar pathway to negatively regulate stem cell proliferation in the floral meristem (FM). Here we show that the FON2 SPARE1 (FOS1) gene encoding a CLE protein functions along with FON2 in maintenance of the FM. In addition, FOS1 appears to be involved in maintenance of the SAM in the vegetative phase, because constitutive expression of FOS1 caused termination of the vegetative SAM. Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways. Initially, we identified FOS1 as a suppressor that originates from O. sativa indica and suppresses the fon2 mutation in O. sativa japonica. FOS1 function in japonica appears to be compromised by a functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP) at the putative processing site of the signal peptide. Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus. Distribution of the FNP also suggests that this mutation may have occurred during the divergence of japonica from its wild ancestor. Stem cell maintenance may be regulated by at least three negative pathways in rice, and each pathway may contribute differently to this regulation depending on the type of the meristem. This situation contrasts with that in Arabidopsis, where CLV signaling is the major single pathway in all meristems.
Plant Cell-2008-Suzaki-2049-58.pdf	Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice	2008	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan.	Postembryonic development in plants depends on the activity of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM). In Arabidopsis thaliana, CLAVATA signaling negatively regulates the size of the stem cell population in the SAM by repressing WUSCHEL. In other plants, however, studies of factors involved in stem cell maintenance are insufficient. Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa). Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM. Constitutive expression of FCP1 results in consumption of the SAM in the vegetative phase, and application of an FCP1 CLE peptide in vitro disturbs root development by misspecification of cell fates in the RAM. FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions. Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2. Our results suggest that, although the basic framework of meristem maintenance is conserved in the angiosperms, the functions of the individual factors have diversified during evolution.

To elucidate the genetic mechanism that regulates meristem maintenance in monocots, here we have examined the function of the gene FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) in Oryza sativa (rice). Mutations in FON2 cause enlargement of the floral meristem, resulting in an increase in the number of floral organs, although the vegetative and inflorescence meristems are largely normal. Molecular cloning reveals that FON2 encodes a small secreted protein, containing a CLE domain, that is closely related to CLAVATA3 in Arabidopsis thaliana. FON2 transcripts are localized at the apical region in all meristems in the aerial parts of rice plants, showing an expression pattern similar to that of Arabidopsis CLV3. Constitutive expression of FON2 causes a reduction in the number of floral organs and flowers, suggesting that both the flower and inflorescence meristems are reduced in size. This action of FON2 requires the function of FON1, an ortholog of CLV1. Constitutive expression of FON2 also causes premature termination of the shoot apical meristem in Arabidopsis, a phenotype similar to that caused by constitutive expression of CLV3. Together with our previous study of FON1, these results clearly indicate that the FON1-FON2 system in rice corresponds to the CLV signaling system in Arabidopsis and suggest that the negative regulation of stem cell identity by these systems may be principally conserved in a wide range of plants within the Angiosperms. In addition, we propose a model of the genetic regulation of meristem maintenance in rice that includes an alternative pathway independent of FON2-FON1.
Plant Physiol.-2006-Chu-1039-52.pdf	The floral organ number4 gene encoding a putative ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA3 regulates apical meristem size in rice	2006	Plant Physiol	Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China.	To understand the molecular mechanism regulating meristem development in the monocot rice (Oryza sativa), we describe here the isolation and characterization of three floral organ number4 (fon4) alleles and the cloning of the FON4 gene. The fon4 mutants showed abnormal enlargement of the embryonic and vegetative shoot apical meristems (SAMs) and the inflorescence and floral meristems. Likely due to enlarged SAMs, fon4 mutants produced thick culms (stems) and increased numbers of both primary rachis branches and floral organs. We identified FON4 using a map-based cloning approach and found it encodes a small putatively secreted protein, which is the putative ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CLAVATA3 (CLV3) gene. FON4 transcripts mainly accumulated in the small group of cells at the apex of the SAMs, whereas the rice ortholog of CLV1 (FON1) is expressed throughout the SAMs, suggesting that the putative FON4 ligand might be sequestered as a possible mechanism for rice meristem regulation. Exogenous application of the peptides FON4p and CLV3p corresponding to the CLV3/ESR-related (CLE) motifs of FON4 and CLV3, respectively, resulted in termination of SAMs in rice, and treatment with CLV3p caused consumption of both rice and Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLV pathway in limiting meristem size is conserved in both rice and Arabidopsis. However, exogenous FON4p did not have an obvious effect on limiting both rice and Arabidopsis root meristems, suggesting that the CLE motifs of Arabidopsis CLV3 and FON4 are potentially functionally divergent.
NA	Mapping and application of the twin-grain1 gene in rice.	2016	Planta	State Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Disease Control, Institute of Crop and Nuclear Technology Utilization, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou, 310021, China.	The map-based cloning and application of a flower organ number gene twin - grain1 provide great potential for improving seed production in hybrid rice. A new germplasm for high-yield rice breeding, the twin-grain1 (tg1) mutant with more than one grain in a glume, was obtained from the Zhejing 22 rice variety via physical mutagenesis. The mapping results showed that TG1 is allelic to FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2)/FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER4 (FON4), a flower organ number gene located at 88.7 cM on chromosome 11. The novel tg1 gene allele was introgressed into the cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) line Zhejing 22A, giving rise to a new CMS line Zhejing 22-tg1A. The Zhejing 22-tg1A line showed enhanced glume opening and stigma exsertion, which increased the outcrossing rate in hybrid rice. A small-scale hybrid rice seed production test demonstrated that the grain yield of the Zhejing 22-tg1A/Zhejinghui 5 line was significantly increased compared to that of the Zhejing 22A/Zhejinghui 5 line. The plot yield evaluation of the F1 hybrid lines showed a higher yield for the Zhejing 22-tg1A/Zhejinghui 5 line than that of the Zhejing 22A/Zhejinghui 5 line. The results implied great potentials for the tg1 gene in hybrid rice breeding.
NA	Genetic Enhancer Analysis Reveals that FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 and OsMADS3 Cooperatively Regulate Maintenance and Determinacy of the Flower Meristem in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 113-8654 Tokyo, Japan.	Meristems such as the shoot apical meristem and flower meristem (FM) act as a reservoir of stem cells, which reproduce themselves and supply daughter cells for the differentiation of lateral organs. In Oryza sativa (rice), FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) gene, which is similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA3, is involved in meristem maintenance. In fon2 mutants, the numbers of floral organs are increased due to an enlargement of the FM. To identify new factors regulating meristem maintenance in rice, we performed a genetic screening of mutants that enhanced the fon2 mutation, and found a mutant line (2B-424) in which pistil number was dramatically increased. By using a map-based approach and next-generation sequencing, we found that the line 2B-424 had a complete loss-of-function mutation (a large deletion) in OsMADS3, a class C MADS-box gene that is known to be involved in stamen specification. Disruption of OsMADS3 in the fon2 mutant by CRISPR-Cas9 technology caused a flower phenotype similar to that of 2B-424, confirming that the gene responsible for enhancement of fon2 was OsMADS3. Morphological analysis showed that the fon2 and osmads3 mutations synergistically affected pistil development and FM determinacy. We also found that whorl 3 was duplicated in mature flowers and the FM was enlarged at an early developmental stage in severe osmads3 single mutants. These findings suggest that OsMADS3 is involved not only in FM determinacy in late flower development but also in FM activity in early flower development.
NA	FON4 prevents the multi-floret spikelet in rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, P. R. China.	The spikelet is the specific unit of the grass inflorescence, and produces a variable number of florets (1-40) depending on whether the species displays determinate or indeterminate growth. Spikelet morphogenesis therefore plays an important role in crop yield; for example, in wheat (Triticum aestivum) inflorescences with the indeterminate spikelet, the spikelet meristem is continuously active and produces a plethora of lateral floral meristems, leading to the formation of variable numbers of florets. In inflorescences of rice (Oryza sativa) and maize (Zea mays) with the determinate spikelet, the spikelet meristem produces the fixed numbers of lateral floral meristems, after which its fate is terminated as a terminal floral meristem, resulting in the formation of one or two florets.

NA	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8654, Japan.	Shoot branches are formed from the axillary meristem and their formation is a key process in plant development. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is progressing, our knowledge of these mechanisms during the process of axillary meristem development is insufficient. To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We revealed that stem cells were established at an early stage of axillary meristem development in wild type, but were not maintained in tab1. By contrast, the stem cell region and TAB1 expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation. These results indicate that TAB1 is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting TAB1 expression. Thus, the genetic pathway regulating SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis seems to have been recruited to play a specific role within a narrow developmental window - namely, axillary meristem establishment - in rice.
