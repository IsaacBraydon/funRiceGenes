FLO15|OsGLYI7	starch	FLOURY ENDOSPERM15 encodes a glyoxalase I involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	 The flo15 grains were characterized by defects in compound starch granule development, along with decreased starch content
FLO15|OsGLYI7	starch	FLOURY ENDOSPERM15 encodes a glyoxalase I involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	 Moreover, the expression of starch synthesis-related genes was obviously altered in the flo15 mutants
FLO15|OsGLYI7	starch	FLOURY ENDOSPERM15 encodes a glyoxalase I involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	 These findings suggest that FLO15 plays an important role in compound starch granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm
FLO15|OsGLYI7	map-based cloning	FLOURY ENDOSPERM15 encodes a glyoxalase I involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	 Map-based cloning of the flo15 mutants identified mutations in OsGLYI7, which encodes a glyoxalase I (GLYI) involved in methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification
FLO15|OsGLYI7	endosperm	FLOURY ENDOSPERM15 encodes a glyoxalase I involved in compound granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm.	 These findings suggest that FLO15 plays an important role in compound starch granule formation and starch synthesis in rice endosperm
