FTL9	grain	A leaf-emanated signal orchestrates grain size and number in response to maternal resources.	 We showed that FT-like 9 (FTL9) regulates both grain size and number and that maternal photosynthetic assimilates induce FTL9 expression in leaves to act as a long-range signal that increases grain number and reduces size
