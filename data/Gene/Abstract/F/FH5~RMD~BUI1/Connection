OsARF24	FH5|RMD|BUI1	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth	Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
OsARF24	FH5|RMD|BUI1	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth	In support of this regulatory loop, osarf23 and lines with reduced expression of both OsARF23 and OsARF24 display reduced RMD expression, disrupted F-actin organization and cell growth, less sensitivity to auxin response, and altered auxin distribution and OsPIN localization.
