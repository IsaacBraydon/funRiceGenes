FH5|RMD|BUI1	OsARF24	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth	Moreover, RMD expression is directly regulated by heterodimerized O. sativa auxin response factor 23 (OsARF23) and OsARF24, providing evidence that auxin modulates the orientation of F-actin arrays through RMD.
FH5|RMD|BUI1	OsARF24	Rice actin-binding protein RMD is a key link in the auxin-actin regulatory loop that controls cell growth	In support of this regulatory loop, osarf23 and lines with reduced expression of both OsARF23 and OsARF24 display reduced RMD expression, disrupted F-actin organization and cell growth, less sensitivity to auxin response, and altered auxin distribution and OsPIN localization.
APG|OsPIL16	FH5|RMD|BUI1	The rice actin-binding protein RMD regulates light-dependent shoot gravitropism.	 RMD gene expression is diurnally controlled and directly repressed by the phytochrome-interacting factor-like protein OsPIL16
APG|OsPIL16	FH5|RMD|BUI1	The rice actin-binding protein RMD regulates light-dependent shoot gravitropism.	 Consequently, over-expression of OsPIL16 led to gravisensing and actin patterning defects that phenocopied the rmd mutant
