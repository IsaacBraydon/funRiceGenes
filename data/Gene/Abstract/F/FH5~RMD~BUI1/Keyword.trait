FH5|RMD|BUI1	chloroplast	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	FH5/RMD is ubiquitously expressed in rice tissues, and its protein localization to the chloroplast surface is mediated by the PTEN domain
FH5|RMD|BUI1	panicle	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
FH5|RMD|BUI1	growth	BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development	Cytological observation indicated that the growth defects of bui1 were caused mainly by inhibition of cell expansion
FH5|RMD|BUI1	seed	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
FH5|RMD|BUI1	dwarf	BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development	The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response
FH5|RMD|BUI1	seedling	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
FH5|RMD|BUI1	growth	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
FH5|RMD|BUI1	inflorescence	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	The rmd mutants display a bending growth pattern in seedlings, are stunted as adult plants, and have aberrant inflorescence (panicle) and seed shape
FH5|RMD|BUI1	cell elongation	RICE MORPHOLOGY DETERMINANT encodes the type II formin FH5 and regulates rice morphogenesis	Cytological analysis showed that rmd mutants have severe cell elongation defects and abnormal microtubule and microfilament arrays
FH5|RMD|BUI1	panicle	BENT UPPERMOST INTERNODE1 encodes the class II formin FH5 crucial for actin organization and rice development	The bui1 mutant displayed pleiotropic phenotypes, including bent uppermost internode, dwarfism, wavy panicle rachis, and enhanced gravitropic response
