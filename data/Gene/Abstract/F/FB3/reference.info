NA	The roles of a novel CDKB/KRP/FB3 cell cycle core complex in rice gametes and initiation of embryogenesis.	2023	Plant Reprod	Department of Microbiology and Plant Biology, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, 73019, USA. hxu28@unl.edu.	The cell cycle controls division and proliferation of all eukaryotic cells and is tightly regulated at multiple checkpoints by complexes of core cell cycle proteins. Due to the difficulty in accessing female gametes and zygotes of flowering plants, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying embryogenesis initiation despite the crucial importance of this process for seed crops. In this study, we reveal three levels of factors involved in rice zygotic cell cycle control and characterize their functions and regulation. Protein-protein interaction studies, including within zygote cells, and in vitro biochemical analyses delineate a model of the zygotic cell cycle core complex for rice. In this model, CDKB1, a major regulator of plant mitosis, is a cyclin (CYCD5)-dependent kinase; its activity is coordinately inhibited by two cell cycle inhibitors, KRP4 and KRP5; and both KRPs are regulated via F-box protein 3 (FB3)-mediated proteolysis. Supporting their critical roles in controlling the rice zygotic cell cycle, mutations in KRP4, KRP5 and FB3 result in the compromised function of sperm cells and abnormal organization of female germ units, embryo and endosperm, thus significantly reducing seed-set rate. This work helps reveal regulatory mechanisms controlling the zygotic cell cycle toward seed formation in angiosperms.
