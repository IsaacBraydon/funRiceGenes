NA	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM10 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein that is essential for the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 and endosperm development.	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, P.R. China.	<U+2022>Endosperm, the major storage organ in cereal grains, determines grain yield and quality. Despite a role for P-type PPR proteins in the regulation of endosperm development has emerged, molecular functions of many P-type PPR proteins remain obscure. <U+2022>Here, we report a rice endosperm defective mutant, floury endosperm10 (flo10), which developed smaller starch grains in starchy endosperm and abnormal cells in aleurone layer. Map-based cloning and rescued experiments showed that FLO10 encodes a P-type PPR protein with 26 PPR motifs, which is localized to mitochondria. Loss function of FLO10 affected the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1, which was accompanied by the increased accumulation of nad1 exon 1 and exons 2-5 precursors. <U+2022>The failed formation of mature nad1 led to a dramatically decreased assembly and activity of complex I, reduced ATP production, and changed mitochondrial morphology. In addition, loss function of FLO10 significantly induced an alternative respiratory pathway involving alternative oxidase (AOXs). <U+2022>These results reveal that FLO10 plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and endosperm development through affecting the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 in rice.
