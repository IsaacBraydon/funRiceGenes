FLO10	development	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM10 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein that is essential for the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 and endosperm development.	 <U+2022>These results reveal that FLO10 plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and endosperm development through affecting the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 in rice
FLO10	mitochondria	Rice FLOURY ENDOSPERM10 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein that is essential for the trans-splicing of mitochondrial nad1 intron 1 and endosperm development.	 Map-based cloning and rescued experiments showed that FLO10 encodes a P-type PPR protein with 26 PPR motifs, which is localized to mitochondria
