NA	FLOURY ENDOSPERM11 encoding a plastid heat shock protein 70 is essential for amyloplast development in rice.	2018	Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China.	Mutations of stromal Hsp70 cause chloroplast developmental abnormalities and knockout mutants of stromal Hsp70 usually exhibit protein import deficiencies. However, their effects have not been studied in amyloplast development. Here, we identified an amyloplast abnormal development mutant, floury endosperm11 (flo11) that exhibited an opaque phenotype in the inner core and the periphery of grains. Semi-thin section revealed defective amyloplast development in the flo11 endosperm. Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation test demonstrated that FLO11 encoded a plastid-localized heat shock protein 70 (OsHsp70cp-2). OsHsp70cp-2 was abundantly expressed in developing endosperm, whereas its paralogous gene OsHsp70cp-1 was mainly expressed in photosynthetic tissues. Ectopic expression of OsHsp70cp-1 under the control of OsHsp70cp-2 promoter rescued the mutant phenotype of flo11. Moreover, simultaneous knockdown of both OsHsp70cp genes resulted in white stripe leaves and opaque endosperm. BiFC and Co-IP assays revealed that OsHsp70cp-2 was associated with Tic complex. Taken together, OsHsp70cp-2 may regulate protein import into amyloplasts, which is essential for amyloplast development in rice.
NA	FLOURY ENDOSPERM11-2 encodes plastid HSP70-2 involved with temperature-dependent chalkiness of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains.	2020	Plant J	Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa, Kyoto, 606-8502, Japan.	The frequent occurrence of chalky rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains becomes a serious problem due to climate change. However, the molecular mechanism underlying chalkiness is largely unknown. In this study, the temperature-sensitive floury endosperm11-2 (flo11-2) mutant was isolated from ion beam-irradiated rice of 1,116 lines. The flo11-2 mutant showed significantly higher chalkiness under mean temperature of 28 °„C than the wild type, but similar levels of chalkiness to the wild type under mean temperature of 24 °„C. Whole exome sequencing of the flo11-2 mutant showed three causal gene candidates, including Os12g0244100, which encodes plastid-localized 70 kDa heat shock protein 2 (cpHSP70-2). The cpHSP70-2 of the flo11-2 mutant has an amino acid substitution on the 259th aspartic acid with valine (D259V) in the conserved Motif 5 of ATPase domain. Transgenic flo11-2 mutants that express the wild type cpHSP70-2 showed significantly lower chalkiness than the flo11-2 mutant. Moreover, the accumulation level of cpHSP70-2 was negatively correlated with chalky ratio, indicating that the cpHSP70-2 is a causal gene for the chalkiness of the flo11-2 mutant. The intrinsic ATPase activity of recombinant cpHSP70-2 was lower by 23% at Vmax in the flo11-2 mutant type than in the wild type. The growth of DnaK-defective Escherichia coli cells complemented with DnaK with D201V mutation (equivalent to the D259V mutation) was severely reduced at 37 °„C, but not in the wild type DnaK. The results indicate that the lowered cpHSP70-2 function is involved with the chalkiness of the flo11-2 mutant.
