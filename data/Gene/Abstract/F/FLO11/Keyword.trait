FLO11	development	FLOURY ENDOSPERM11 encoding a plastid heat shock protein 70 is essential for amyloplast development in rice.	 Semi-thin section revealed defective amyloplast development in the flo11 endosperm
FLO11	map-based cloning	FLOURY ENDOSPERM11 encoding a plastid heat shock protein 70 is essential for amyloplast development in rice.	 Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation test demonstrated that FLO11 encoded a plastid-localized heat shock protein 70 (OsHsp70cp-2)
FLO11	endosperm	FLOURY ENDOSPERM11 encoding a plastid heat shock protein 70 is essential for amyloplast development in rice.	 Semi-thin section revealed defective amyloplast development in the flo11 endosperm
