FSE1	development	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	 Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing fse1 endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development
FSE1	development	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	 Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm, and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development
FSE1	starch	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	 Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm, and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development
FSE1	map-based cloning	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	 Map-based cloning showed that FSE1 encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1
FSE1	endosperm	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	 Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing fse1 endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development
