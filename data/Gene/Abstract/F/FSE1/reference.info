NA	FLOURY SHRUNKEN ENDOSPERM1 connects phospholipid metabolism and amyloplast development in rice.	2018	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	Starch synthesized and stored in amyloplasts serves as the major energy storage molecule in cereal endosperm. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloplast development and starch synthesis, we isolated a series of floury endosperm mutants in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We identified the rice mutant floury shrunken endosperm1 (fse1), which exhibited obvious defects in the development of compound starch grains, decreased starch content, and altered starch physicochemical features. Map-based cloning showed that FSE1 encodes a phospholipase-like protein homologous to phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1. FSE1 was expressed ubiquitously with abundant levels observed in developing seeds and roots. FSE1 was localized to both the cytosol and intracellular membranes. Lipid profiling indicated that total extra-plastidic lipids and phosphatidic acid were increased in fse1 plants, suggesting that FSE1 may exhibit in vivo phospholipase A1 activity on phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and, in particular, phosphatidic acid. Additionally, the total galactolipid content in developing fse1 endosperm was significantly reduced, which may cause abnormal amyloplast development. Our results identify FSE1 as a phospholipase-like protein that controls the synthesis of galactolipids in rice endosperm, and provide a novel connection between lipid metabolism and starch synthesis in rice grains during endosperm development.
