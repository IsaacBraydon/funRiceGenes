NA	The rice FISH BONE gene encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase, which affects pleiotropic auxin-related processes	2014	Plant J	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	Auxin is a fundamental plant hormone and its localization within organs plays pivotal roles in plant growth and development. Analysis of many Arabidopsis mutants that were defective in auxin biosynthesis revealed that the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) pathway, catalyzed by the TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA) and YUCCA (YUC) families, is the major biosynthetic pathway of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). In contrast, little information is known about the molecular mechanisms of auxin biosynthesis in rice. In this study, we identified a auxin-related rice mutant, fish bone (fib). FIB encodes an orthologue of TAA genes and loss of FIB function resulted in pleiotropic abnormal phenotypes, such as small leaves with large lamina joint angles, abnormal vascular development, small panicles, abnormal organ identity and defects in root development, together with a reduction in internal IAA levels. Moreover, we found that auxin sensitivity and polar transport activity were altered in the fib mutant. From these results, we suggest that FIB plays a pivotal role in IAA biosynthesis in rice and that auxin biosynthesis, transport and sensitivity are closely interrelated.
NA	TILLERING AND SMALL GRAIN 1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family required for local auxin biosynthesis in rice.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics &amp; Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology &amp; Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academic of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Auxin is a crucial phytohormone, controlling multiple aspects of plant growth and responses to the changing environment. However, the role of local auxin biosynthesis in specific developmental programs remains unknown in crops. This study characterized the rice tillering and small grain 1 (tsg1) mutant, which has more tillers but a smaller panicle and grain size resulting from a reduction in endogenous auxin. TSG1 encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase that is allelic to the FISH BONE (FIB) gene. The tsg1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to IAA and the competitive inhibitor of aminotransferase, L-kynurenine. TSG1 knockout resulted in an increased tiller number but reduction in grain number and size, and decrease in height. Meanwhile, deletion of the TSG1 homologs OsTAR1, OsTARL1, and OsTARL2 caused no obvious changes, although the phenotype of the TSG1/OsTAR1 double mutant was intensified and infertile, suggesting gene redundancy in the rice tryptophan aminotransferase family. Interestingly, TSG1 and OsTAR1, but not OsTARL1 and OsTARL2, displayed marked aminotransferase activity. Meanwhile, subcellular localization was identified as the endoplasmic reticulum, while phylogenetic analysis revealed functional divergence of TSG1 and OsTAR1 from OsTARL1 and OsTARL2. These findings suggest that TSG1 dominates the tryptophan aminotransferase family, playing a prominent role in local auxin biosynthesis in rice. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	Targeted Phytohormone Profiling Identifies Potential Regulators of Spikelet Sterility in Rice under Combined Drought and Heat Stress.	2021	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Crop Physiology, University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bangalore 560065, Karnataka, India.	Rice cultivated under rainfed or semi-irrigated ecosystems is frequently exposed to a combination of drought and heat stress. As a sensitive crop at the reproductive stage, exposure to combined drought and heat stress will have a deleterious effect on yield. In this study, two rice cultivars with contrasting spikelet sterility, AVT2-5315 (low sterility) and AC35027 (high sterility), under combined stress were selected for physiological characterization and phytohormonal profiling at anthesis. Under combined stress, both cultivars did not differ in the physiological parameters such as relative water content, photosynthetic rate, light-adapted chlorophyll fluorescence and biomass, suggesting a similar source activity under stress. However, AVT2-5315 showed better yield due to better pollen and spikelet fertility than AC35027, suggesting its intrinsic tolerance ability under combined stress. Targeted profiling of 15 phytohormones from drought, heat and combined stress-treated flag leaf and spikelet tissues using LC-MS/MS showed increased accumulation of auxins (indole 3-acetic acid and indole 3-butyric acid) in flag leaves and jasmonic acid in spikelets of AVT2-5315, while there was increased accumulation of ethylene in flag leaves and methyl-jasmonate in spikelets of AC35027. Increased accumulation of these hormones correlated with key biosynthetic pathway genes. In the flag leaves, increased accumulation of auxins was correlated with increased transcript levels of YUCCA-like gene 1 (OsYUCCA1) and fish bone (OsFIB), in AVT2-5315 under combined stress. In AC35027, increased ethylene content was correlated with expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 1 (OsASC1) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid oxidase 2 (OsACO2). Similarly, in spikelets, increased accumulation of jasmonic acid in AVT2-5315 was correlated with expression of allene oxide cyclase (OsAOC) and 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase 1 (OsOPR1). The mechanism of regulating spikelet sterility by these hormones needs further investigation towards improving rice tolerance to combined stress.
