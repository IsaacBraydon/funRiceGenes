OsWRKY13|WRKY13	v2	Gene network mediated by WRKY13 to regulate resistance against sheath infecting fungi in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 To compute and evaluate the possible molecular mechanism for observed resistance correlated to WRKY13 gene expression, rice gene expression profiles against bacterial leaf blight and leaf blast disease from ROAD database were used to prioritize the locus IDs that were used as input in RiceNet v2 tool
