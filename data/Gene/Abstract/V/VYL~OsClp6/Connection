CLPP4	VYL|NAL9	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo
CLPP4	VYL|NAL9	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4
