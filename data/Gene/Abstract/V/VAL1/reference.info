NA	VIRESCENT-ALBINO LEAF 1 regulates leaf colour development and cell division in rice.	2018	J Exp Bot	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.	The de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides is crucial to all living organisms, but limited information is available for plants. In this study, we isolated a virescent-albino leaf 1 (val1) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa) that produces dynamic green-revertible albino and narrow-leaf phenotypes. In albino leaves, chloroplast development was defective, pigment contents were reduced, and cell division was impaired compared with the wild-type. Map-based cloning revealed that VAL1 encodes a phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (PurD), the second enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in the chloroplast. Our results demonstrate that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and is involved in regulating chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, and cell division during leaf development in rice.
NA	Purine nucleotide biosynthetic gene GARS controls early chloroplast development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	GARS encodes an enzyme catalyzing the second step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis and plays an important role to maintain the development of chloroplasts in juvenile plants by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes. A series of rice white striped mutants were previously described. In this research, we characterized a novel gars mutant with white striped leaves at the seedling stage. By positional cloning, we identified the mutated gene, which encodes a glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase (GARS) that catalyzes the second step of purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Thylakoid membranes were less abundant in the albinic sectors of mutant seedling leaves compared to the wild type. The expression levels of genes involved in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis were changed. Contents of ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP and GDP, which are crucial for plant growth and development, were decreased in the mutant seedlings. Complementation and CrispR tests confirmed the role of the GARS allele, which was expressed in all rice tissues, especially in the leaves. GARS protein displayed a typical chloroplast location pattern in rice protoplasts. Our results indicated that GARS was involved in chloroplast development at early leaf development by affecting the expression of plastid-encoded genes.
