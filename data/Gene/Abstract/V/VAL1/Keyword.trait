VAL1|GARS	leaf	VIRESCENT-ALBINO LEAF 1 regulates leaf colour development and cell division in rice.	 Our results demonstrate that VAL1 is a crucial enzyme in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway and is involved in regulating chloroplast development, chlorophyll metabolism, and cell division during leaf development in rice
VAL1|GARS	chloroplast	VIRESCENT-ALBINO LEAF 1 regulates leaf colour development and cell division in rice.	 Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that VAL1 was localized in the chloroplast
