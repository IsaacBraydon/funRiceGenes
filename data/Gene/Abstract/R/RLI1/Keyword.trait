RLI1	leaf	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 The rli1 mutants showed reduced leaf inclination and the RLI1 over-expressors showed increased leaf inclination
RLI1	leaf	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
RLI1	leaf	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice
RLI1	brassinosteroid	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
RLI1	Brassinosteroid	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
RLI1	lamina	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
RLI1	Pi	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice
RLI1	 pi 	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice
RLI1	lamina joint	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	 RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination
