NA	An SPX-RLI1 module regulates leaf inclination in response to phosphate availability in rice.	2018	Plant Cell	Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Leaf erectness is one of the key traits of plant architecture; in grains, plants with upright leaves can be planted close together, thus benefiting yield/unit area. Many factors, such as hormones, affect leaf inclination; however, how nutrition status, in particular phosphate (Pi) availability, affects leaf inclination remains largely unexplained. Here, we show that in rice (Oryza sativa), Pi-deficiency stress inhibits lamina joint cell elongation, thus restricting lamina joint size and inducing leaf erectness in rice. The Pi-starvation induced proteins SPX1 (named after Syg1/Pho81/XPR1) and SPX2 play a negative role in the regulation of leaf inclination. We further identified an SPX1-interacting protein, Regulator of Leaf Inclination 1 (RLI1), which positively regulates leaf inclination by affecting lamina joint cell elongation in rice. The rli1 mutants showed reduced leaf inclination and the RLI1 over-expressors showed increased leaf inclination. RLI1 directly activates the downstream genes BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1 (BU1) and BU1-LIKE 1 COMPLEX1 (BC1) to control elongation of the lamina joint cells, therefore enhancing leaf inclination. We also found that Pi-deficiency repressed the expression of RLI1. SPX1 protein interacts directly with RLI1, which could prevent RLI1 binding to the promoters of downstream genes. Therefore, SPX and RLI1 form a module to regulate leaf inclination in response to external Pi availability in rice.
NA	Modulation of nitrate-induced phosphate response by the MYB transcription factor RLI1/HINGE1 in the nucleus	2020	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China; School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.	The coordinated utilization of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) is vital for plants to maintain nutrient balance and achieve optimal growth. Previously, we revealed a mechanism by which nitrate induces genes for phosphate utilization; this mechanism depends on NRT1.1B-facilitated degradation of cytoplasmic SPX4, which in turn promotes cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of PHR2, the central transcription factor of phosphate signaling, and triggers the nitrate-induced phosphate response (NIPR) and N-P coordinated utilization in rice. In this study, we unveiled a fine-tuning mechanism of NIPR in the nucleus regulated by Highly Induced by Nitrate Gene 1 (HINGE1, also known as RLI1), a MYB-transcription factor closely related to PHR2. RLI1/HINGE1, which is transcriptionally activated by PHR2 under nitrate induction, can directly activate the expression of phosphate starvation-induced genes. More importantly, RLI1/HINGE1 competes with PHR2 for binding to its repressor proteins in the nucleus (SPX proteins), and consequently releases PHR2 to further enhance phosphate response. Therefore, RLI1/HINGE1 amplifies the phosphate response in the nucleus downstream of the cytoplasmic SPX4-PHR2 cascade, thereby enabling fine-tuning of N-P balance when nitrate supply is sufficient.
