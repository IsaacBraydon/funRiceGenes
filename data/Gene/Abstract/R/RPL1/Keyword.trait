RPL1	brassinosteroid	RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice	Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene
RPL1	phytohormone	RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice	These data suggest that RPL1 regulated phenotypic plasticity likely through its involvement in epigenetic processes affecting responses of the plant to phytohormones
