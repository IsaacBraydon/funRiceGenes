RIR1	 Here, we found that a Tos17 insertion mutant of LRR_RLK displayed increasing temporal resistance to Xoo, whereas the LRR_RLK overexpression lines were susceptible to the pathogen early on in the infection, indicating that LRR_RLK encodes a repressor of rice resistance to Xoo infection, and it was renamed as RIR1 (Rice Immunity Repressor 1) |  RIR1 overexpression plants were more susceptible to Xoo at late growth stage, suggesting that RIR1 mRNA levels are negatively correlated with the resistance of rice against Xoo |  Notably, impairment of RIR1 or overexpression of NUO resulted in reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced expression of pathogen-resistance genes, including jasmonic acid pathway genes	 Here, we found that a Tos17 insertion mutant of LRR_RLK displayed increasing temporal resistance to Xoo, whereas the LRR_RLK overexpression lines were susceptible to the pathogen early on in the infection, indicating that LRR_RLK encodes a repressor of rice resistance to Xoo infection, and it was renamed as RIR1 (Rice Immunity Repressor 1) |  RIR1 overexpression plants were more susceptible to Xoo at late growth stage, suggesting that RIR1 mRNA levels are negatively correlated with the resistance of rice against Xoo |  Notably, impairment of RIR1 or overexpression of NUO resulted in reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced expression of pathogen-resistance genes, including jasmonic acid pathway genes
