NA	RIR1 represses plant immunity by interacting with mitochondrial complex I subunit in rice	2021	Mol Plant Pathol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	We previously observed decreased expression of rice OsmiR159a.1 on infection with the bacterial blight-causing pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), and identified the OsLRR_RLK (leucine-rich repeat_ receptor like kinase) gene as an authentic target of OsmiR159a.1. Here, we found that a Tos17 insertion mutant of LRR_RLK displayed increasing temporal resistance to Xoo, whereas the LRR_RLK overexpression lines were susceptible to the pathogen early on in the infection, indicating that LRR_RLK encodes a repressor of rice resistance to Xoo infection, and it was renamed as RIR1 (Rice Immunity Repressor 1). RIR1 overexpression plants were more susceptible to Xoo at late growth stage, suggesting that RIR1 mRNA levels are negatively correlated with the resistance of rice against Xoo. We discovered that OsmiR159a.1 repression in Xoo-infected plants was largely dependent on the pathogen's type III secretion system. Co-immunoprecipitation, bimolecular fluoresence complementation, and pull-down assays indicated that RIR1 interacted with the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NUO) 51-kDa subunit of the mitochondrial complex I through its kinase domain. Notably, impairment of RIR1 or overexpression of NUO resulted in reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced expression of pathogen-resistance genes, including jasmonic acid pathway genes. We propose that pathogens may inhibit OsmiR159 to interfere with the RIR1-NUO interaction, and subsequently depression of rice immune signalling pathways. The resistance genes manipulated by Xoo can be a probe to explore the regulatory network during host-pathogen interactions.
