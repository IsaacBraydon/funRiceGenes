RAI1	transcription factor	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	 RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor| In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1
RAI1	blast	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	 The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus
RAI1	defense response	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	 These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice
RAI1	defense	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	 These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice
