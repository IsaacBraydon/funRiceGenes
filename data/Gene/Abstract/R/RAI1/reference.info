Kim-2012-The bHLH Rac Immunit.pdf	The bHLH Rac Immunity1 (RAI1) Is Activated by OsRac1 via OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 in Rice Immunity	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	The Rac/Rop GTPase OsRac1 plays an essential role in rice immunity. However, the regulatory genes acting downstream of OsRac1 are largely unknown. We focused on the RAI1 gene, which is up-regulated in suspension cells expressing a constitutively active form of OsRac1. RAI1 encodes a putative basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. A microarray analysis of cells transformed with an inducible RAI1 construct showed increased expression of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes after induction, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RAI1. This was confirmed using RAI1 T-DNA activation-tagged and RNA interference lines. The PAL1 and OsWRKY19 genes were also up-regulated by sphingolipid and chitin elicitors, and the RAI1 activation-tagged plants had increased resistance to a rice blast fungus. These results indicated that RAI1 is involved in defense responses in rice. RAI1 interacted with OsMAPK3 and OsMAPK6 proteins in vivo and in vitro. Also, RAI1 was phosphorylated by OsMAPK3/6 and OsMKK4-dd in vitro. Overexpression of OsMAPK6 and/or OsMAPK3 together with OsMKK4-dd increased PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression in rice protoplasts. Therefore, the regulation of PAL1 and OsWRKY19 expression by RAI1 could be controlled via an OsMKK4-OsMAPK3/6 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that OsMAPK3 and OsRac1 occur in the same complex as OsMAPK6. Taken together, our results indicate that RAI1 could be regulated by OsRac1 through an OsMAPK3/6 cascade. In this study, we have identified RAI1 as the first transcription factor acting downstream of OsRac1. This work will help us to understand the immune system regulated by OsRac1 in rice and its orthologs in other plant species.
NA	The OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 defense signaling pathway is shared by two distantly related NLR proteins in rice blast resistance.	2021	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Ecological Control of Fujian-Taiwan Crop Pests, Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Genetics, Breeding and Multiple Utilization of Crops, Plant Immunity Center, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350002, China.	Resistance (R) proteins are important components of plant innate immunity. Most known R proteins are nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins. Although a number of signaling components downstream of NLRs have been identified, we lack a general understanding of the signaling pathways. Here, we used the interaction between rice (Oryza sativa) and Magnaporthe oryzae to study signaling of rice NLRs in response to blast infection. We found that in blast resistance mediated by the NLR PIRICULARIA ORYZAE RESISTANCE IN DIGU 3 (PID3), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor OsSPK1 works downstream of PID3. OsSPK1 activates the small GTPase OsRac1, which in turn transduces the signal to the transcription factor RAC IMMUNITY1 (RAI1). Further investigation revealed that the three signaling components also play important roles in disease resistance mediated by the distantly related NLR protein Pi9, suggesting that the OsSPK1-OsRac1-RAI1 signaling pathway could be conserved across rice NLR-induced blast resistance. In addition, we observed changes in RAI1 levels during blast infection, which led to identification of OsRPT2a, a subunit of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. OsRPT2a seemed to be responsible for RAI1 turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Collectively, our results suggest a defense signaling route that might be common to NLR proteins in response to blast infection.
