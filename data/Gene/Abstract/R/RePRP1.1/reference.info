In the root of rice (Oryza sativa), abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, salinity, or water deficit stress induces the expression of a family of four genes, REPETITIVE PROLINE-RICH PROTEIN (RePRP). These genes encode two subclasses of novel proline-rich glycoproteins with highly repetitive PX(1)PX(2) motifs, RePRP1 and RePRP2. RePRP orthologs exist only in monocotyledonous plants, and their functions are virtually unknown. Rice RePRPs are heavily glycosylated with arabinose and glucose on multiple hydroxyproline residues. They are significantly different from arabinogalactan proteins that have glycan chains composed of arabinose and galactose. Transient and stable expressions of RePRP-green fluorescent protein reveal that a fraction of this protein is localized to the plasma membrane. In rice roots, ABA treatment increases RePRP expression preferentially in the elongation zone. Overexpression of RePRP in transgenic rice reduces root cell elongation in the absence of ABA, similar to the effect of ABA on wild-type roots. Conversely, simultaneous knockdown of the expression of RePRP1 and RePRP2 reduces the root sensitivity to ABA, indicating that RePRP proteins play an essential role in ABA/stress regulation of root growth and development. Moreover, rice RePRPs specifically interact with a polysaccharide, arabinogalactan, in a dosage-dependent manner. It is suggested that RePRP1 and RePRP2 are functionally redundant suppressors of root cell expansion and probably act through interactions with cell wall components near the plasma membrane.
j.1399-3054.2003.00104.x.pdf	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	2003	Physiologia Plantarum	Department of Low Temperature Science, National Agricultural Research Center for Hokkaido Region, 1 Hitsujigaoka, Toyohira, Sapporo, Hokkaido 062â€<U+393C><U+3E33>8555, Japan	Differential screening was performed on a cDNA library made from RNAs isolated from rice seedlings (variety Yukihikari) grown in submergence condition. A cDNA clone (OsPRP) encoding a repetitive proline-rich protein of 358 amino acids and molecular weight of 39 kDa was obtained. The C-terminal region of OsPRP contains proline (P) residues (40%), and high levels of glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K). The N-terminus was free from proline residues. Sequence analysis indicated that 40 distinct PEPK repetitive sequence motifs were present in the sequence along with other repetitive motifs. Furthermore, four phosphorylation sites were predicted from the sequence. The domain structure of OsPRP was compared with proline-rich proteins from other monocot species. The N-terminus of OsPRP is highly hydrophobic indicating the presence of a signal peptide. Southern blot data indicate that in the Yukihikari genome OsPRP is most likely encoded by a single gene. The expression of OsPRP was relatively uniform in the young seedlings. However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression. In addition, OsPRP expression is regulated by various environmental factors and is down-regulated under submergence stress. Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript.
