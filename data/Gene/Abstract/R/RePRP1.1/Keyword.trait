OsPRP|RePRP1.1	seedling	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	 The expression of OsPRP was relatively uniform in the young seedlings
OsPRP|RePRP1.1	shoot	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	 However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression
OsPRP|RePRP1.1	root	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	 However, tissue-specific expression of OsPRP indicated that shoot tissue accumulates more mRNA, and the root has relatively low expression
OsPRP|RePRP1.1	jasmonate	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript
OsPRP|RePRP1.1	submergence	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	" In addition, OsPRP expression is regulated by various environmental factors and is down-regulated under submergence stress|Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)"
OsPRP|RePRP1.1	growth	Isolation and characterization of a gene for a repetitive proline rich protein (OsPRP) down-regulated during submergence in rice (Oryza sativa)	 Exogenous application of growth hormones, namely abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJ) and ethephon caused significant repression of the OsPRP transcript
