Yamagata-2000-Molecular cloning an.pdf	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a cDNA and a Gene for Subtilisin-like Serine Proteases from Rice (Oryza sativaL.) andArabidopsis thaliana	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Kobe University	The complete nucleotide sequences of a cDNA (RSP1) that encodes a subtilisin-like serine protease (subtilase) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and a gene (ASP48) for Arabidopsis subtilase were analyzed. The RSP1 cDNA and ASP48 DNA encoded 736- and 757-residue pre-pro-polypeptides including a signal peptide with molecular masses of 78,668 Da and 79,414 Da, respectively. RSP1 is the first known serine protease in rice, and ASP48 is a gene for ara12 cDNA. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that RSP1 is distantly related to all other plant subtilases and ASP48 is closely related to a tomato subtilase, SBT1. The ASP48 gene was found to lack introns. The Arabidopsis subtilase gene appears to consist of a small gene family. The RSP1 was found to be expressed in seed and shoots of seedlings while ASP48 transcripts was found to be accumulated in immature silique and flowers, indicating that both RSP1 and ASP48 are organ-specific and may be involved in the specific proteolytic events that occur during organ development.
