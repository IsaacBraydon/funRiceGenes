RNG1	blight	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits
RNG1	bacterial blight	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits
