OsCPL1|sh-h	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Characterization and mapping of a shattering mutant in rice that corresponds to a block of domestication genes	The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the Rc locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice
Kala4|OsS1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.	Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments
OsCIPK2	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Exploring the Potential of Overexpressed OsCIPK2 Rice as a Nitrogen Utilization Efficient Crop and Analysis of Its Associated Rhizo-Compartmental Microbial Communities.	 Two isogenic lines Kitaake (WT) and its genetically modified line CIPK2 (RC), overexpressing the gene for Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 2 (OsCIPK2) with better nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), were compared for their growth and development under low versus normal levels of N
OSVP1|VP1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 To identify this association's molecular mechanism, a PHS mutant Osviviparous1 (Osvp1) was characterized in rice and crossed with Kasalath, a red pericarp cultivar with Rc (red coleoptiles) genotype
OSVP1|VP1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice
OSVP1|VP1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1
OSVP1|VP1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
OsC1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1
OsC1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	 These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance
