OsCPL1|sh-h	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Characterization and mapping of a shattering mutant in rice that corresponds to a block of domestication genes	The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the Rc locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice
Kala4|OsS1	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.	Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments
OsCIPK2	Rc|qSD7-1|qPC7	Exploring the Potential of Overexpressed OsCIPK2 Rice as a Nitrogen Utilization Efficient Crop and Analysis of Its Associated Rhizo-Compartmental Microbial Communities.	 Two isogenic lines Kitaake (WT) and its genetically modified line CIPK2 (RC), overexpressing the gene for Calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase 2 (OsCIPK2) with better nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), were compared for their growth and development under low versus normal levels of N
