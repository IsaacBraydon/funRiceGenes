1515.pdf	Association between seed dormancy and pericarp color is controlled by a pleiotropic gene that regulates abscisic acid and flavonoid synthesis in weedy red rice	2011	Genetics	Plant Science Department, South Dakota State University, Brookings, South Dakota 57007, USA. xingyou.gu@sdstate.edu	Seed dormancy has been associated with red grain color in cereal crops for a century. The association was linked to qSD7-1/qPC7, a cluster of quantitative trait loci for seed dormancy/pericarp color in weedy red rice. This research delimited qSD7-1/qPC7 to the Os07g11020 or Rc locus encoding a basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factor by intragenic recombinants and provided unambiguous evidence that the association arises from pleiotropy. The pleiotropic gene expressed in early developing seeds promoted expression of key genes for biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), resulting in an increase in accumulation of the dormancy-inducing hormone; activated a conserved network of eight genes for flavonoid biosynthesis to produce the pigments in the lower epidermal cells of the pericarp tissue; and enhanced seed weight. Thus, the pleiotropic locus most likely controls the dormancy and pigment traits by regulating ABA and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively. The dormancy effect could be eliminated by a heat treatment, but could not be completely overcome by gibberellic acid or physical removal of the seed maternal tissues. The dormancy-enhancing alleles differentiated into two groups basically associated with tropical and temperate ecotypes of weedy rice. Of the pleiotropic effects, seed dormancy could contribute most to the weed adaptation. Pleiotropy prevents the use of the dormancy gene to improve resistance of white pericarp cultivars against pre-harvest sprouting through conventional breeding approaches.
19-tmp.pdf	Characterization and mapping of a shattering mutant in rice that corresponds to a block of domestication genes	2006	Genetics	National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology, Rural Development Administration, Suwon, Korea.	Easy shattering reduces yield due to grain loss during harvest in cereals. Shattering is also a hindrance in breeding programs that use wild accessions because the shattering habit is often linked to desirable traits. We characterized a shattering mutant line of rice, Hsh, which was derived from a nonshattering japonica variety, Hwacheong, by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) treatment. The breaking tensile strength (BTS) of the grain pedicel was measured using a digital force gauge to evaluate the degree of shattering of rice varieties at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 days after heading (DAH). The BTS of Hwacheong did not decrease with increasing DAH, maintaining a level of 180-240 gf, while that of Hsh decreased greatly during 10-20 DAH and finally stabilized at 50 gf. Optical microscopy revealed that Hsh had a well-developed abscission layer similar to the wild rice Oryza nivara (accession IRGC105706), while Hwacheong did not produce an abscission layer, indicating that the shattering of Hsh was caused by differentiation of the abscission layer. On the basis of the BTS value and morphology of the abscission layer of F(1) plants and segregation data in F(2) populations, it was concluded that the easy shattering of Hsh was controlled by the single recessive gene sh-h. The gene sh-h was determined to be located on rice chromosome 7 by bulked segregant analysis. Using 14 SSR markers on rice chromosome 7, the gene sh-h was mapped between the flanking markers RM8262 and RM7161 at distances of 1.6 and 2.0 cM, respectively. An SSR marker Rc17 cosegregated with the gene sh-h. The locus sh-h for shattering was tightly linked to the Rc locus conferring red pericarp, as well as a QTL qSD(s)-7-1 for seed dormancy, implying that this region might represent a domestication block in the evolutionary pathway of rice.

Crop domestication can serve as a model of plant evolutionary processes. It involves a series of selection events from standing natural variation and newly occurring mutations and combinations of mutations as a result of natural crossings in populations during local adaptation and propagation of plant lines to other cultivation areas. Our earlier identification of three functional nucleotide polymorphisms (FNPs) of distinct genes involved in the rice domestication process led us to propose a model of the japonica rice domestication process. Here, we examined three more FNPs in two domestication-related genes involved in pigment synthesis during the development of seed pericarp color (Rc and Rd) in 91 landraces (and some modern cultivars) of japonica rice collected from throughout the area of distribution of rice. These polymorphisms were assigned by using genome-wide patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and the local origins of the landraces. The results led us to infer the process of japonica rice domestication in more detail and propose a more refined model of the japonica domestication process. In this model, the critical role of the Rc FNP at an early step of the domestication process was highlighted. Independent artificial selections of two defective Rd alleles were found, suggesting a role for Rd other than in pigment synthesis during rice domestication.
j.1365-313X.2006.02958.x.pdf	The Rc and Rd genes are involved in proanthocyanidin synthesis in rice pericarp	2007	Plant J	Genetic Diversity Department, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Different colors, such as purple, brown, red and white, occur in the pericarp of rice. Here, two genes affecting proanthocyanidin synthesis in red- and brown-colored rice were elucidated. Genetic segregation analysis suggested that the Rd and A loci are identical, and both encode dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR). The introduction of the DFR gene into an Rcrd mutant resulted in red-colored rice, which was brown in the original mutant, demonstrating that the Rd locus encodes the DFR protein. Accumulation of proanthocyanidins was observed in the transformants by the introduction of the Rd gene into the rice Rcrd line. Protein blot analysis showed that the DFR gene was translated in seeds with alternative translation initiation. A search for the Rc gene, which encodes a transacting regulatory factor, was conducted using available DNA markers and the Rice Genome Automated Annotation System program. Three candidate genes were identified and cloned from a rice RcRd line and subsequently introduced into a rice rcrd line. Brown-colored seeds were obtained from transgenic plants by the introduction of a gene containing the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motif, demonstrating that the Rc gene encodes a bHLH protein. Comparison of the Rc locus among rice accessions showed that a 14-bp deletion occurred only in the rc locus.
nihms238258.pdf	The molecular basis of white pericarps in African domesticated rice: novel mutations at the Rc gene	2010	J Evol Biol	Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA	Repeated phenotypic evolution can occur at both the inter- and intraspecific level and is especially prominent in domesticated plants, where artificial selection has favoured the same traits in many different species and varieties. The question of whether repeated evolution reflects changes at the same or different genes in each lineage can now be addressed using the domestication and improvement genes that have been identified in a variety of crops. Here, we document the genetic basis of nonpigmented (â€˜whiteâ€<U+393C><U+3E39>) pericarps in domesticated African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and compare it with the known genetic basis of the same trait in domesticated Asian rice (Oryza sativa). In some cases, white pericarps in African rice are apparently caused by unique mutations at the Rc gene, which also controls pericarp colour variation in Asian rice. In one case, white pericarps appear to reflect changes at a different gene or potentially a cis-regulatory region.
pgen.0030133.pdf	Global dissemination of a single mutation conferring white pericarp in rice	2007	PLoS Genet	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, United States of America.	Here we report that the change from the red seeds of wild rice to the white seeds of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) resulted from the strong selective sweep of a single mutation, a frame-shift deletion within the Rc gene that is found in 97.9% of white rice varieties today. A second mutation, also within Rc, is present in less than 3% of white accessions surveyed. Haplotype analysis revealed that the predominant mutation originated in the japonica subspecies and crossed both geographic and sterility barriers to move into the indica subspecies. A little less than one Mb of japonica DNA hitchhiked with the rc allele into most indica varieties, suggesting that other linked domestication alleles may have been transferred from japonica to indica along with white pericarp color. Our finding provides evidence of active cultural exchange among ancient farmers over the course of rice domestication coupled with very strong, positive selection for a single white allele in both subspecies of O. sativa.
Plant Cell-2006-Sweeney-283-94.pdf	Caught red-handed: Rc encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein conditioning red pericarp in rice	2006	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14953-1901, USA.	Rc is a domestication-related gene required for red pericarp in rice (Oryza sativa). The red grain color is ubiquitous among the wild ancestors of O. sativa, in which it is closely associated with seed shattering and dormancy. Rc encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein that was fine-mapped to an 18.5-kb region on rice chromosome 7 using a cross between Oryza rufipogon (red pericarp) and O. sativa cv Jefferson (white pericarp). Sequencing of the alleles from both mapping parents as well as from two independent genetic stocks of Rc revealed that the dominant red allele differed from the recessive white allele by a 14-bp deletion within exon 6 that knocked out the bHLH domain of the protein. A premature stop codon was identified in the second mutant stock that had a light red pericarp. RT-PCR experiments confirmed that the Rc gene was expressed in both red- and white-grained rice but that a shortened transcript was present in white varieties. Phylogenetic analysis, supported by comparative mapping in rice and maize (Zea mays), showed that Rc, a positive regulator of proanthocyanidin, is orthologous with INTENSIFIER1, a negative regulator of anthocyanin production in maize, and is not in the same clade as rice bHLH anthocyanin regulators.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00122-008-0801-8.pdf	A natural mutation in rc reverts white-rice-pericarp to red and results in a new, dominant, wild-type allele: Rc-g	2008	Theor Appl Genet	USDA ARS, Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center, 2890 Hwy. 130 E., Stuttgart, Arkansas 72160, USA. ricegenes@mac.com	The Rc locus regulates pigmentation of the rice bran layer, and selection for the rc allele (white pericarp) occurred during domestication of the crop. White bran is now ubiquitous among cultivated varieties throughout rice growing regions of the world. We identified a new allele that arose by natural mutation within the rc pseudogene of the cultivar 'Wells'. The mutation restored the reading frame of the gene, and reverted the bran layer pigmentation to red (wild-type). By sequencing the Rc locus in plants derived from red seeds, and linkage analysis in a segregating population, we were able to demonstrate that mutation within rc resulted in the new, dominant, wild-type allele Rc-g.
NA	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional recovery of the recessive rc allele to develop red rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	Xiamen Key Laboratory for Plant Genetics, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361102, China.	Red rice contains high levels of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, which have been recognized as health-promoting nutrients. The red colouration of rice grains is controlled by two complementary genes, Rc and Rd. The RcRd genotype produces red pericarp in wild species Oryza rufipogon, whereas most cultivated rice varieties produce white grains resulted from a 14-bp frame-shift deletion in the seventh exon of the Rc gene. In the present study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated method to functionally restore the recessive rc allele through reverting the 14-bp frame-shift deletion to in-frame mutations in which the deletions were in multiples of three bases, and successfully converted three elite white pericarp rice varieties into red ones. Rice seeds from T1 in-frame Rc lines were measured for proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins, and high accumulation levels of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanidins were observed in red grains from the mutants. Moreover, there was no significant difference between wild type and in-frame Rc mutants in major agronomic traits, indicating that restoration of Rc function had no negative effect on important agronomic traits in rice. Given that most white pericarp rice varieties are resulted from the 14-bp deletion in Rc, it is conceivable that our method could be applied to most white pericarp rice varieties and would greatly accelerate the breeding of new red rice varieties with elite agronomic traits. In addition, our study demonstrates an effective approach to restore recessive frame-shift alleles for crop improvement. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Transcription Factors Rc and OsVP 1 Coordinately Regulate Preharvest Sprouting Tolerance in Red Pericarp Rice	2021	J Agric Food Chem	Key Laboratory of Soybean Molecular Design Breeding, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harbin 150081, China.	Red pericarp associates with seed dormancy or preharvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance in crops. To identify this association's molecular mechanism, a PHS mutant Osviviparous1 (Osvp1) was characterized in rice and crossed with Kasalath, a red pericarp cultivar with Rc (red coleoptiles) genotype. Among the dehulled seeds of F2 progenies, RcRcvp1vp1 seeds performed a lower PHS rate than rcrcvp1vp1 seeds and showed shallower pigmentation than RcRcVP1VP1 seeds. Kasalath and SL9 (an RcRcVP1VP1 substitution line with Nipponbare background) showed more ABA sensitivity than the Nipponbare (rcrcVP1VP1) by the germination assay, and the transcriptional abundance of ABA signal genes OsABI2, OsSnRK2, OsVP1, ABI5, and especially OsVP1 increased in the red pericarp line SL9. Moreover, OsVP1 can directly bind Rc (bHLH) promoter by yeast one-hybrid, which activates Rc and OsLAR expression in red pericarp rice. Furthermore, a luciferase complementation imaging assay showed that OsVP1 interacts with transcriptions factors Rc and OsC1. These results indicate that OsVP1 promotes proanthocyanidin accumulation through the interaction among OsVP1, Rc, and OsC1 and then increases the plant's ABA sensitivity and PHS resistance.
NA	Explore the genetics of weedy traits using rice 3K database	2021	Bot Stud	Department of Agronomy, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Da'an Dist., Taipei, 10617, Taiwan.	Background: Weedy rice, a conspecific weedy counterpart of the cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.), has been problematic in rice-production area worldwide. Although we started to know about the origin of some weedy traits for some rice-growing regions, an overall assessment of weedy trait-related loci was not yet available. On the other hand, the advances in sequencing technologies, together with community efforts, have made publicly available a large amount of genomic data. Given the availability of public data and the need of "weedy" allele mining for a better management of weedy rice, the objective of the present study was to explore the genetic architecture of weedy traits based on publicly available data, mainly from the 3000 Rice Genome Project (3K-RGP).  Results: Based on the results of population structure analysis, we have selected 1378 individuals from four sub-populations (aus, indica, temperate japonica, tropical japonica) without admixed genomic composition for genome-wide association analysis (GWAS). Five traits were investigated: awn color, seed shattering, seed threshability, seed coat color, and seedling height. GWAS was conducted for each sub-population ¡Á trait combination and we have identified 66 population-specific trait-associated SNPs. Eleven significant SNPs fell into an annotated gene and four other SNPs were close to a putative candidate gene (¡À 25 kb). SNPs located in or close to Rc were particularly predictive of the occurrence of seed coat color and our results showed that different sub-populations required different SNPs for a better seed coat color prediction. We compared the data of 3K-RGP to a publicly available weedy rice dataset. The profile of allele frequency, phenotype-genotype segregation of target SNP, as well as GWAS results for the presence and absence of awns diverged between the two sets of data.  Conclusions: The genotype of trait-associated SNPs identified in this study, especially those located in or close to Rc, can be developed to diagnostic SNPs to trace the origin of weedy trait occurred in the field. The difference of results from the two publicly available datasets used in this study emphasized the importance of laboratory experiments to confirm the allele mining results based on publicly available data.
