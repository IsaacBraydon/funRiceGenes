1-s2.0-S0168945208000472-main.pdf	An expression analysis profile for the entire sucrose synthase gene family in rice	2008	Plant Science	National Agricultural Research Center, 1-2-1 Inada, Joetsu, Niigata 943-0193, Japan	In rice three genes encoding for sucrose synthase (Sus) (EC 2.4.1.13) have previously been characterized, and a further three sequences for putative Sus genes reported. The current work confirms that these six genes comprise the entire rice Sus gene family. An expression analysis was conducted in various rice tissues using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Sus transcripts were detected in a wide range of tissues and at different developmental stages, indicating that Sus is involved in numerous and diverse growth processes in the rice plant. SUS1 was predominantly expressed in elongating tissues including roots, developing leaves and internodes; a potential role for SUS1 in cellulose synthesis is discussed. SUS2 was shown to be expressed in a wide range of tissues, suggesting that it may perform a number of housekeeping role(s). In addition, overall Sus activity and expression of SUS2 increased significantly in seedlings germinated and grown in hypoxia (submerged conditions), suggesting a role in increasing sucrose metabolism as a response to environmental stress. SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain. Transcript levels of SUS5 and SUS6 were low in all tissues examined, and were suppressed in germinating shoots under submergence.
60_233.pdf	Complete Structures of Three Rice Sucrose Synthase Isogenes and Differential Regulation of Their Expressions	1996	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University 2) Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University 	By cloning and sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA and transcription initiation site mapping, the total structures including at least 1 kb of putative regulatory sequences upstream of the transcription initiation sites of three genes encoding rice sucrose synthase isoprotomers were either newly established or amended. The third type of SS gene, RSus3, has not been found in other plants. The structures of the three genes and the gene products were compared and their evolutionary sequence was proposed. Specific probes for the three SS mRNA's were developed and used for analyzing their steady state levels at different organs and under some physiological stress conditions. It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3. A possible cause of the presence of the third rice SS gene was discussed. We also reported a novel method to synthesize single-stranded DNA for S1 mapping of a transcription initiation site associated with extended secondary structures.
J Hered-2011-Lestari-735-46.pdf	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	2011	J Hered	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening. Because the genetic diversity of this locus is not known yet, the full sequence of RSUS3 from 43 rice varieties was amplified to examine the distribution of DNA polymorphisms. A total of 254 sequence variants, including SNPs and insertion/deletions, were successfully identified in the 7733 bp sequence that comprises the promoter, exons and introns, and 3' downstream nontranscribed region (NTR). Eleven haplotypes were distinguished among the 43 rice varieties based on nucleotide variation in the 3 defined regions (5' NTR, transcript, and 3' NTR). The promoter region showed evidence of a base change on a cis-element that might influence the functional role of the motif in seed-specific expression. The genetic diversity of the RSUS3 gene sequences in the rice germplasm used in this study appears to be the result of nonrandom processes. Analysis of polymorphism sites indicated that at least 11 recombinations have occurred, primarily in the transcribed region. This finding provides insight into the development of a cladistic approach for establishing future genetic association studies of the RSUS3 locus.
