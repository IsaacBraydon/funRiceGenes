RSUS3|SUS3	seed	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	starch	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	endosperm	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	grain	Complete Structures of Three Rice Sucrose Synthase Isogenes and Differential Regulation of Their Expressions	 It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3
RSUS3|SUS3	grain	An expression analysis profile for the entire sucrose synthase gene family in rice	 SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain
