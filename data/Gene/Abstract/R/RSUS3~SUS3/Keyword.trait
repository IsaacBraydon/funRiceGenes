RSUS3|SUS3	seed	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	starch	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	endosperm	Single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotype diversity in rice sucrose synthase 3	Rice sucrose synthase 3 (RSUS3) is expressed predominantly in rice seed endosperm and is thought to play an important role in starch filling during the milky stage of rice seed ripening
RSUS3|SUS3	grain	Complete Structures of Three Rice Sucrose Synthase Isogenes and Differential Regulation of Their Expressions	It appears that RSus2 is a house-keeping gene, RSus3 is highly specific to the grain, and the expression of RSus1 shows a tendency to complement that of RSus3
RSUS3|SUS3	grain	An expression analysis profile for the entire sucrose synthase gene family in rice	SUS3 and SUS4 were predominantly expressed in the caryopsis, indicating potential roles in carbon allocation within the filling grain
RSUS3|SUS3	tolerance	Thermo-responsive allele of sucrose synthase 3 (Sus3) provides high-temperature tolerance during the ripening stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 In addition, we transformed the 'Habataki' Sus3 gene into 'Nipponbare', and the transformants obtained high-temperature tolerance
RSUS3|SUS3	tolerance	Thermo-responsive allele of sucrose synthase 3 (Sus3) provides high-temperature tolerance during the ripening stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Therefore, we conclude that the causal gene underlying the QTL Apq1 is the thermo-responsive Sus3 allele, and the increase in Sus3 expression under high-temperature condition during ripening leads to high-temperature tolerance in rice
RSUS3|SUS3	sucrose	Thermo-responsive allele of sucrose synthase 3 (Sus3) provides high-temperature tolerance during the ripening stage in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Among these, the temporal expression pattern of sucrose synthase 3 (Sus3) corresponded well with the high temperature-sensitive period during ripening, and expression of the 'Habataki' allele of Sus3 was increased under high-temperature condition
