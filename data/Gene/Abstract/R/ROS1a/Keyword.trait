ROS1a|OsROS1a	meristem	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
ROS1a|OsROS1a	vegetative	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
ROS1a|OsROS1a	dormancy	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
ROS1a|OsROS1a	seed	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development

ROS1a|OsROS1a	vegetative	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.
ROS1a|OsROS1a	vegetative	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.	 Here, we report genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in wild-type and ros1a mutant sperm and vegetative cells
ROS1a|OsROS1a	vegetative	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.	 We find that the rice vegetative cell genome is locally hypomethylated compared with sperm by a process that requires ROS1a activity
ROS1a|OsROS1a	vegetative	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.	 We show that many ROS1a target sequences in the vegetative cell are hypomethylated in the rice central cell, suggesting that ROS1a also demethylates the central cell genome
ROS1a|OsROS1a	development	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT
ROS1a|OsROS1a	pollen	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The osros1a mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility
ROS1a|OsROS1a	pollen	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT
ROS1a|OsROS1a	anther	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT
ROS1a|OsROS1a	sterility	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).
ROS1a|OsROS1a	sterility	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).

ROS1a|OsROS1a	sterility	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Combined with previous studies, our findings suggested that the RRMF domain in OsROS1a is the functional domain and loss of RRMF for OsROS1a causes sterility in rice
ROS1a|OsROS1a	starch	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The osros1a mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility
