ROS1a	meristem	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
ROS1a	vegetative	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
ROS1a	dormancy	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
ROS1a	seed	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
ROS1a	pollen	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells
ROS1a	endosperm	A null mutation of ROS1a for DNA demethylation in rice is not transmittable to progeny	 Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development
