ROS1a|OsROS1a	 Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT |  Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants |  The expression of OsROS1a in the mutants was not changed, but it produced a frame-shift mutation to truncate the Pem-CXXC and RRMF domains
