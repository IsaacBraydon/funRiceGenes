Genes that promote DNA methylation and demethylation in plants have been characterized mainly in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis DNA demethylation is mediated by bi-functional DNA enzymes with glycosylase activity that removes 5-methylcytosine and lyase activity that nicks double-stranded DNA at an abasic site. Homologous recombination-promoted knock-in targeting of the ROS1a gene, the longest of six putative DNA demethylase genes in the rice genome, by fusing its endogenous promoter to the GUS reporter gene, led to reproducibly disrupted ROS1a in primary (T(0)) transgenic plants in the heterozygous condition. These T(0) plants exhibited no overt morphological phenotypes during the vegetative phase, and GUS staining showed ROS1a expression in pollen, unfertilized ovules and meristematic cells. Interestingly, neither the maternal nor paternal knock-in null allele, ros1a-GUS1, was virtually detected in the progeny; such an intransmittable null mutation is difficult to isolate by conventional mutagenesis techniques that are usually used to identify and isolate mutants in the progeny population. Even in the presence of the wild-type paternal ROS1a allele, the maternal ros1a-GUS1 allele caused failure of early-stage endosperm development, resulting in incomplete embryo development, with embryogenesis producing irregular but viable embryos that failed to complete seed dormancy, implying non-equivalent maternal and paternal contribution of ROS1a in endosperm development. The paternal ros1a-GUS1 allele was not transmitted to progeny, presumably because of a male gametophytic defect(s) prior to fertilization. Thus, ROS1a is indispensable in both male and female gametophytes, and DNA demethylation must plays important roles in both gametophytes.
NA	DNA demethylation by ROS1a in rice vegetative cells promotes methylation in sperm.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.	Epigenetic reprogramming is required for proper regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. In Arabidopsis, active DNA demethylation is crucial for seed viability, pollen function, and successful reproduction. The DEMETER (DME) DNA glycosylase initiates localized DNA demethylation in vegetative and central cells, so-called companion cells that are adjacent to sperm and egg gametes, respectively. In rice, the central cell genome displays local DNA hypomethylation, suggesting that active DNA demethylation also occurs in rice; however, the enzyme responsible for this process is unknown. One candidate is the rice REPRESSOR OF SILENCING1a (ROS1a) gene, which is related to DME and is essential for rice seed viability and pollen function. Here, we report genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation in wild-type and ros1a mutant sperm and vegetative cells. We find that the rice vegetative cell genome is locally hypomethylated compared with sperm by a process that requires ROS1a activity. We show that many ROS1a target sequences in the vegetative cell are hypomethylated in the rice central cell, suggesting that ROS1a also demethylates the central cell genome. Similar to Arabidopsis, we show that sperm non-CG methylation is indirectly promoted by DNA demethylation in the vegetative cell. These results reveal that DNA glycosylase-mediated DNA demethylation processes are conserved in Arabidopsis and rice, plant species that diverged 150 million years ago. Finally, although global non-CG methylation levels of sperm and egg differ, the maternal and paternal embryo genomes show similar non-CG methylation levels, suggesting that rice gamete genomes undergo dynamic DNA methylation reprogramming after cell fusion.
NA	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Hainan Institute, Zhejiang University, Sanya 572025, China.	For crop seed production, the development of anthers and male fertility are the main agronomic traits and key biological processes for flowering plants. Active DNA demethylation regulates many plant developmental processes and is ensured by 5-meC DNA glycosylase enzymes. To find out the role of OsROS1a, OsROS1a gene editing mutants were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The osros1a mutants had shrink spikelets, smaller anthers and pollen grains, and were not stained by iodine staining showing a significant reduction in total soluble sugar and starch contents as compared to wildtype (WT), which caused complete male sterility. Similarly, the expression of genes involved in pollen and anther development was decreased in osros1a mutants as compared to WT. Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants. DNA methylation of the TDR gene promoter was similar between WT and osros1a mutants, indicating that the DNA methylation effect by OsROS1a was gene specific. The expression of OsROS1a in the mutants was not changed, but it produced a frame-shift mutation to truncate the Pem-CXXC and RRMF domains. Combined with previous studies, our findings suggested that the RRMF domain in OsROS1a is the functional domain and loss of RRMF for OsROS1a causes sterility in rice.
