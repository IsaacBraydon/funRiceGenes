OsPKS2	ROS1a|OsROS1a	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Furthermore, bisulfite sequencing showed that the CG and CHG methylation of the OsPKS2 gene promoter was significantly increased in the osros1a mutant, which caused a reduced expression of OsPKS2 in osros1a mutants
ROS1a|OsROS1a	TDR	Loss of Function of the RRMF Domain in OsROS1a Causes Sterility in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 DNA methylation of the TDR gene promoter was similar between WT and osros1a mutants, indicating that the DNA methylation effect by OsROS1a was gene specific
