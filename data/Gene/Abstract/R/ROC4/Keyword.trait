ROC4	flowering time	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7
ROC4	flowering time	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	This confirmed that Roc4 regulates flowering time mainly through Ghd7
