ROC4	 Expression of Rice outermost cell-specific gene 4 (Roc4), encoding a homeodomain Leu-zipper class IV family protein, was significantly increased |  Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in ‘Dongjin’ japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in ‘Longjing27′ rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result |  Transgenic plants showed ubiquitous expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene under the Roc4 promoter	 Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in ‘Dongjin’ japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in ‘Longjing27′ rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result
