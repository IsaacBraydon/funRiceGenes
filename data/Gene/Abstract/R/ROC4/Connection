Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in Dongjin japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in Longjing27 rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	This confirmed that Roc4 regulates flowering time mainly through Ghd7
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	All of these findings are evidence that Roc4 is an LD-preferential flowering enhancer that functions downstream of phytochromes and OsGI, but upstream of Ghd7
OsGI	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI) function upstream of Roc4
OsGI	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	All of these findings are evidence that Roc4 is an LD-preferential flowering enhancer that functions downstream of phytochromes and OsGI, but upstream of Ghd7
DHS	ROC4	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 DHS exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacted with the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV protein ROC4
DHS	ROC4	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 ROC4 degradation was promoted by DHS but delayed in dhs mutants
DHS	ROC4	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 ROC4 acts downstream of DHS, and Os-BDG is a direct downstream target of the DHS-ROC4 cascade
DHS	ROC4	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 These results suggest a mechanism whereby DHS negatively regulates wax biosynthesis by promoting the degradation of ROC4, and they suggest that DHS and ROC4 are valuable targets for the engineering of drought-tolerant rice cultivars
Ehd5	ROC4	The WD40 domain-containing protein Ehd5 positively regulates flowering in rice (Oryza sativa).	 Functional analysis showed that Ehd5 directly interacts with Rice outermost cell-specific gene 4 (Roc4) and Grain number, plant height, and heading date 8 (Ghd8), which might affect the formation of Ghd7-Ghd8 complexes, resulting in increased expression of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
