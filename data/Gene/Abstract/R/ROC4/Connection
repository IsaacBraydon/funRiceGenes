Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	Whereas constitutive overexpression of Roc4 in Dongjin japonica rice, which carries active Ghd7, also caused LD-preferential early flowering, its overexpression in Longjing27 rice, which is defective in functional Ghd7, did not produce the same result
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	This confirmed that Roc4 regulates flowering time mainly through Ghd7
Ghd7	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	All of these findings are evidence that Roc4 is an LD-preferential flowering enhancer that functions downstream of phytochromes and OsGI, but upstream of Ghd7
OsGI	ROC4	GL2-type homeobox gene Roc4 in rice promotes flowering time preferentially under long days by repressing Ghd7	sativa GIGANTEA (OsGI) function upstream of Roc4
