Hd3a	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Overexpression of RIFLA in rice repressed OsMADS56 expression but activated the expression of flowering inducers Hd3a and RFT1
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Under normal conditions, the transcript level of the rice enhancer of zeste gene OsiEZ1, a homolog of Arabidopsis histone H3K27-specific methyltransferase genes SWINGER (SWN) and CURLY LEAF (CLF), was as low as that of RIFLA, whereas the transcript level of OsMADS56 was relatively high
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 In the osiez1 mutant, OsMADS56 expression was upregulated, whereas RIFLA expression was downregulated
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Additionally, RIFLA formed a complex with OsiEZ1
OsiEZ1|OsSET1|SDG718	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Together, these results suggest that the floral repressor activity of OsMADS56 is epigenetically regulated by RIFLA and OsiEZ1
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	), RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), is required for the inhibition of OsMADS56 expression
OsMADS56|GL10	RIFLA	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 RIFLA is produced from the first intron of the OsMADS56 gene
