RIFLA	floral	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Together, these results suggest that the floral repressor activity of OsMADS56 is epigenetically regulated by RIFLA and OsiEZ1
RIFLA	flowering	Intronic long noncoding RNA, RICE FLOWERING ASSOCIATED (RIFLA), regulates OsMADS56-mediated flowering in rice.	 Overexpression of RIFLA in rice repressed OsMADS56 expression but activated the expression of flowering inducers Hd3a and RFT1
