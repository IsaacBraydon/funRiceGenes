Symbol	Expression
RCN11	 The level of RCN11/OsXylT expression was regulated by multiple phytohormones and various abiotic stresses suggesting that plant specific N-glycosylation is regulated by multiple signals in rice plants
RCN11	 The rcn11 mutant has no mutation in the RCN1/OsABCG5 gene and rcn11 has no effect on RCN1/OsABCG5 gene expression
