OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	Since the shoot architecture of the rcn11 was very similar to that of the rcn1, we examined whether RCN11 is involved in RCN1/OsABCG5-associated vegetative growth control
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	A genetic allelism test and molecular mapping study showed that rcn11 is independent of rcn1 on rice chromosome 3 and located on chromosome 8
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	The rcn1 rcn11 phenotype suggests that RCN11 acts on vegetative growth independent of RCN1/OsABCG5
OsXylT|RCN11	Rcn1|OsABCG5	The rice REDUCED CULM NUMBER11 gene controls vegetative growth under low-temperature conditions in paddy fields independent of RCN1/OsABCG5.	A root development comparison between rcn1 and rcn11 in young seedlings represented that rcn11 reduced crown root number and elongation, whereas rcn1 reduced lateral root density and elongation
Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	CRISPR/Cas9-mediated OsXylT and OsFucT mutation caused the elimination of plant-specific ¦Â1,2-xylose and ¦Á1,3-fucose residues on glycoproteins in rice, which is the first report of OsXylT/OsFucT double KO mutation in rice
Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	 As an effort to use plants as a platform to produce biopharmaceuticals, the plant-specific N-glycan genes of rice (Oryza sativa), ¦Â1,2-xylT (OsXylT) and ¦Á1,3-FucT (OsFucT), were knocked out using multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 technology
Osfuct	OsXylT|RCN11	Inactivation of the ¦Â (1, 2)-xylosyltransferase and the ¦Á (1, 3)-fucosyltransferase gene in rice (Oryza sativa) by multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 strategy	 Thus, we suggest that each enzymes working on the process for complex N-glycan biosynthesis might independently act in rice, hence the double knock-out of both OsXylT and OsFucT might be not enough to humanize N-glycan structure in rice
