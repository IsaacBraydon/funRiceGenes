Durand-2005-Emergence of a subfa.pdf	Emergence of a subfamily of xylanase inhibitors within glycoside hydrolase family 18	2005	FEBS J	Institute of Food Research (IFR), Norwich, UK.	The xylanase inhibitor protein I (XIP-I), recently identified in wheat, inhibits xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 10 (GH10) and 11 (GH11). Sequence and structural similarities indicate that XIP-I is related to chitinases of family GH18, despite its lack of enzymatic activity. Here we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a XIP-type inhibitor from rice. Despite its initial classification as a chitinase, the rice inhibitor does not exhibit chitinolytic activity but shows specificities towards fungal GH11 xylanases similar to that of its wheat counterpart. This, together, with an analysis of approximately 150 plant members of glycosidase family GH18 provides compelling evidence that xylanase inhibitors are largely represented in this family, and that this novel function has recently emerged based on a common scaffold. The plurifunctionality of GH18 members has major implications for genomic annotations and predicted gene function. This study provides new information which will lead to a better understanding of the biological significance of a number of GH18 'inactivated' chitinases.
Nagasaki-1997-Rice class III chiti.pdf	Rice class III chitinase homologues isolated by random cloning of rice cDNAs	1997	DNA Res	Rice Genome Research Program, Institute of the Society for Techno-innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Ibaraki, Japan.	We obtained seven kinds of cDNA clones putatively identified as encoding class III chitinases from cDNA libraries constructed from dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)- and benzyl adenine (BA)- treated rice callus. Putative amino acid sequences encoded in these cDNA clones were compared with those of known chitinases of other plants. Two clones coded for homologues that show high similarity to class III chitinases. These clones contained the common glutamic acid at the active site and were classified as true homologues. The other five clones, however, showed relatively low similarity to class III chitinases and their active sites contained aspartic acid instead of glutamic acid. These clones may correspond to relatives of a super family of class III chitinases. The location of the genes coding for these homologues on the rice genome has been determined by genetic linkage analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Tokunaga-700-14.pdf	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Biosphere Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, 739-8528 Japan.	Rice microarray analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA). The gene designated as AK073843 which is homologous to class capital SHA, Cyrillic chitinase was found to exhibit the highest induction among these genes. However, its crucial residues within the chitinase active site are substituted with other residues, suggesting that the protein has no chitinase activity. The recombinant protein which is encoded by the AK073843 gene produced in Escherichia coli has xylanase inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor protein (OsXIP). The expression of OsXIP was enhanced not only by exogenous AsA treatment but also by various stresses such as citrate and sodium chloride treatments, and wounding; however, it was not influenced by increasing endogenous AsA content. External AsA treatment caused a significant increase in electrolyte leakage from rice root. These results suggested that OsXIP was induced by stress which is caused by external AsA treatment. Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression. Also, these genes were differentially induced by stress and stress-related phytohormones. The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root. RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones. Thus, XIP-type xylanase inhibitors were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in rice.
