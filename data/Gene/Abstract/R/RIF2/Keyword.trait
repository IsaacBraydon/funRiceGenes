RIF2	mitochondria	A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	A study of subcellular localization demonstrated that only RIF2 was targeted to mitochondria
RIF2	fertility	A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
RIF2	Ubiquitin	A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	RIF2 encodes ubiquitin domain-containing protein
