Rf2	RIF2	A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	coli-produced recombinant GST-tagged RF2 and His-tagged RIF2 confirmed that RF2 interacted with RIF2
Rf2	RIF2	A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.	These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
