RASI	insect	Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli	The recombinant inhibitor had strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin, with an equimolar relationship, comparable with that of native RASI, and weak inhibitory activity toward some microbial alpha-amylases, but not toward animal or insect alpha-amylases
RASI	seed	Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli	RASI was found to be expressed only in seeds, suggesting that it has a seed-specific function
RASI	seed	Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli	These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms
RASI	defense	Rice bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitoe: cloning and characterization of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli	These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms
