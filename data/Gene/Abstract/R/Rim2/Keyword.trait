Rim2	cell wall	The rice Rim2 transcript accumulates in response to Magnaporthe grisea and its predicted protein product shares similarity with TNP2-like proteins encoded by CACTA transposons	The Rim2 transcript also accumulated in response to treatment with a cell wall elicitor derived from M
Rim2	disease	The rice Rim2 transcript accumulates in response to Magnaporthe grisea and its predicted protein product shares similarity with TNP2-like proteins encoded by CACTA transposons	05-kb segment of the Rim2 sequence shows 82% nucleotide sequence identity with sequences flanking the A1 and C members of the rice Xa21 disease resistance gene family
Rim2	disease resistance	The rice Rim2 transcript accumulates in response to Magnaporthe grisea and its predicted protein product shares similarity with TNP2-like proteins encoded by CACTA transposons	05-kb segment of the Rim2 sequence shows 82% nucleotide sequence identity with sequences flanking the A1 and C members of the rice Xa21 disease resistance gene family
