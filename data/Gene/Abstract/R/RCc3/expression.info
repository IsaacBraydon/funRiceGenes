RCc3	Overexpression of RCc3 improves root system architecture and enhances salt tolerance in rice. |  RCc3 overexpression produced pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture, including increased growth of primary root, adventitious roots and lateral roots at the seedling stage |  Further study indicated that auxin accumulation in the root was increased through auxin local biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in RCc3 overexpression lines |  Moreover, overexpression of RCc3 remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt stress, with the elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes |  Taken together, the data showed that RCc3 overexpression can improve rice root system, promote plant growth, and enhance plant tolerance to salt stress	Overexpression of RCc3 improves root system architecture and enhances salt tolerance in rice. |  RCc3 overexpression produced pleiotropic phenotypes of improved root system architecture, including increased growth of primary root, adventitious roots and lateral roots at the seedling stage |  Further study indicated that auxin accumulation in the root was increased through auxin local biosynthesis and polar auxin transport in RCc3 overexpression lines |  Moreover, overexpression of RCc3 remarkably enhanced the tolerance to salt stress, with the elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes |  Taken together, the data showed that RCc3 overexpression can improve rice root system, promote plant growth, and enhance plant tolerance to salt stress
