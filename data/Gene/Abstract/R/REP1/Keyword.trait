REP1	palea	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
REP1	floral	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development
REP1	floral	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
REP1	floral	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry
REP1	stamen	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
REP1	flower	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
REP1	vascular bundle	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea
REP1	vascular bundle	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma
REP1	palea	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development

REP1	transcription factor	An AT-hook protein DEPRESSED PALEA1 physically interacts with the TCP family transcription factor RETARDED PALEA1 in rice.	 DP1 is an AT-hook protein while REP1 is a TCP transcription factor, both of which are important regulators of palea development
