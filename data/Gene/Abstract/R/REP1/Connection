DP1	REP1	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
DP1	REP1	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 We further found that SDP1/REP1 is downstreamly regulated by DP1
