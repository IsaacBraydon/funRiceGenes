DP1	REP1|OsTb2	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
DP1	REP1|OsTb2	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	We further found that SDP1/REP1 is downstreamly regulated by DP1
DP1	REP1|OsTb2	An AT-hook protein DEPRESSED PALEA1 physically interacts with the TCP family transcription factor RETARDED PALEA1 in rice.	 Previously, we identified rice depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants with defects in main structure of palea and its enhancer RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1)
DP1	REP1|OsTb2	An AT-hook protein DEPRESSED PALEA1 physically interacts with the TCP family transcription factor RETARDED PALEA1 in rice.	 DP1 is an AT-hook protein while REP1 is a TCP transcription factor, both of which are important regulators of palea development
DP1	REP1|OsTb2	An AT-hook protein DEPRESSED PALEA1 physically interacts with the TCP family transcription factor RETARDED PALEA1 in rice.	 Here, we demonstrated that DP1 interacts physically with REP1 both in yeast and in rice protoplasts
