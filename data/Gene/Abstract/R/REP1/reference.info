Grasses have highly specialized flowers and their outer floral organ identity remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized rice mutants that specifically disrupted the development of palea, one of the outer whorl floral organs. The depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides. The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants. In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration. Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size. E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp1-2 mutant. We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development. The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor. We further found that SDP1/REP1 is downstreamly regulated by DP1.
pp1490235.pdf	RETARDED PALEA1 controls palea development and floral zygomorphy in rice	2009	Plant Physiol	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Poaceae, one of the largest flowering plant families in angiosperms, evolved distinct inflorescence and flower morphology diverging from eudicots and other monocots. However, the mechanism underlying the specification of flower morphology in grasses remains unclear. Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development. The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea. The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma. Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry. This work therefore extends the function of the TCP gene family members in defining the diversification of floral morphology in grasses and suggests that a common conserved mechanism controlling floral zygomorphy by CYC-like genes exists in both eudicots and the grasses.
NA	An AT-hook protein DEPRESSED PALEA1 physically interacts with the TCP family transcription factor RETARDED PALEA1 in rice.	2017	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; Reproductive Physiology Laboratory, National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing 100081, China.	The cereal crops (such as rice and maize) which belong to the grass family, are the most important grain crops for human beings, and the development of their flower and inflorescence architecture have attracted extensive attention. Although multiple genes involved in the regulation of floral and inflorescence organogenesis have been identified, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Previously, we identified rice depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants with defects in main structure of palea and its enhancer RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1). DP1 is an AT-hook protein while REP1 is a TCP transcription factor, both of which are important regulators of palea development. However, the relationship of these two proteins has not been elucidated yet. Here, we demonstrated that DP1 interacts physically with REP1 both in yeast and in rice protoplasts. Considering the close phylogenetic relationship between maize and rice, we further hypothesize that their orthologs in maize, BARREN STALK FASTIGIATE (BAF1) and BRANCH ANGLE DEFECTIVE 1 (BAD1), may interact physically. Subsequently, we verified their physical interaction, indicating that the interaction between AT-hook proteins and TCP proteins is conserved in rice and maize. Our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism of floral and inflorescence development in grasses.
NA	Neo-functionalization of a Teosinte branched 1 homologue mediates adaptations of upland rice.	2020	Nat Commun	State Key laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bio-Resources in Yunnan, Research Center for Perennial Rice Engineering and Technology of Yunnan, School of Agriculture, Yunnan University, 650091, Kunming, Yunnan, China.	The rice orthologue of maize domestication gene Teosinte branched 1 (Tb1) affects tillering. But, unlike maize Tb1 gene, it was not selected during domestication. Here, we report that an OsTb1 duplicate gene (OsTb2) has been artificially selected during upland rice adaptation and that natural variation in OsTb2 is associated with tiller number. Interestingly, transgenic rice overexpressing this gene shows increased rather than decreased tillering, suggesting that OsTb2 gains a regulatory effect opposite to that of OsTb1 following duplication. Functional analyses suggest that the OsTb2 protein positively regulates tillering by interacting with the homologous OsTb1 protein and counteracts the inhibitory effect of OsTb1 on tillering. We further characterize two functional variations within OsTb2 that regulate protein function and gene expression, respectively. These results not only present an example of neo-functionalization that generates an opposite function following duplication but also suggest that the Tb1 homologue has been selected in upland rice.
