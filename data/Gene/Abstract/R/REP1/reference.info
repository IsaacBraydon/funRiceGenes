Grasses have highly specialized flowers and their outer floral organ identity remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized rice mutants that specifically disrupted the development of palea, one of the outer whorl floral organs. The depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides. The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants. In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration. Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size. E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp1-2 mutant. We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development. The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor. We further found that SDP1/REP1 is downstreamly regulated by DP1.

Poaceae, one of the largest flowering plant families in angiosperms, evolved distinct inflorescence and flower morphology diverging from eudicots and other monocots. However, the mechanism underlying the specification of flower morphology in grasses remains unclear. Here we show that floral zygomorphy along the lemma-palea axis in rice (Oryza sativa) is partially or indirectly determined by the CYCLOIDEA (CYC)-like homolog RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1), which regulates palea identity and development. The REP1 gene is only expressed in palea primordium during early flower development, but during later floral stages is radially dispersed in stamens and the vascular bundles of the lemma and palea. The development of palea is significantly retarded in the rep1 mutant and its palea has five vascular bundles, which is similar to the vascular pattern of the wild-type lemma. Furthermore, ectopic expression of REP1 caused the asymmetrical overdifferentiation of the palea cells, altering their floral asymmetry. This work therefore extends the function of the TCP gene family members in defining the diversification of floral morphology in grasses and suggests that a common conserved mechanism controlling floral zygomorphy by CYC-like genes exists in both eudicots and the grasses.
