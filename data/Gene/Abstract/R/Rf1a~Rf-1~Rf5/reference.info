10.1007-BF02884944.pdf	Mapping of the nuclear fertility restorer gene for HL cytoplasmic male sterility in rice using microsatellite markers	2000	Chinese Science Bulletin	College of Life Science, Wuhan University, 430072, Wuhan, China	Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of a BC, population derived from Congguang 41A//Miyang 23/Congguang 41B was used to map the nuclear fertility restorer gene for Honglian (HL) cytoplasmic male sterility. One hundred and fifty-nine microsatellite primer pairs were screened for polymorphisms between the parents and between two bulks representing fertile and sterile plants. One microsatellite marker RM258 produced polymorphic products. The nuclear fertility restorer gene for HL cytoplasmic male sterility was mapped on chromosome 10, 7.8cM from RM258. The restorer gene may be clustered on chromosome.

We have found a rice Rf-1 gene that restores BT-type CMS by applying a positional cloning strategy. Using linkage analysis in combination with 6,104 BC(1)F(3) progeny derived from a cross between two near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing only at the Rf-1 locus, we delimited the Rf-1 gene to a 22.4-kb region in the rice genome. Duplicate open reading frames ( Rf-1A and Rf-1B) with a pentatricopeptide (PPR) motif were found in this region. Since several insertions and/or deletions were found in the regions corresponding to both the Rf-1A and Rf-1B genes in the maintainer's allele, they may have lost their function. Rf-1A protein had a mitochondria-targeting signal, whereas Rf-1B did not. The Rf-1B gene encoded a shorter polypeptide that was determined by a premature stop codon. Based on the function of the Rf-1 gene, its product is expected to target mitochondria and may process the transcript from an atp6/orf79 region in the mitochondrial genome. Since the Rf-1A gene encodes a 791-amino acid protein with a signal targeting mitochondria and has 16 repeats of the PPR motif, we concluded that Rf-1A is the Rf-1 gene. Nine duplications of Rf-1A homologs were found around the Rf-1 locus in the Nipponbare genome. However, while some of them encoded proteins with the PPR motif, they do not restore BT-type CMS based on the lack of co-segregation with the restoration phenotype. These duplicates may have played diversified roles in RNA processing and/or recombination in mitochondria during the co-evolution of these genes and the mitochondrial genome.

In indica rice, the HongLian (HL)-type combination of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and fertility restoration (Rf) is widely used for the production of commercial hybrid seeds in China, Laos, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. Generally, any member of the gametophytic fertility restoration system, 50% of the pollen in hybrid F(1) plants displays recovered sterility. In this study, however, a HL-type hybrid variety named HongLian You6 had approximately 75% normal (viable) pollen rather than the expected 50%. To resolve this discrepancy, several fertility segregation populations, including F(2) and BC(1)F(1) derived from the HL-CMS line Yuetai A crossed with the restorer line 9311, were constructed and subjected to genetic analysis. A gametophytic restoration model was discovered to involve two non-allelic nuclear restorer genes, Rf5 and Rf6. The Rf5 had been previously identified using a positional clone strategy. The Rf6 gene represents a new restorer gene locus, which was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 8. The hybrid F(1) plants containing one restorer gene, either Rf5 or Rf6, displayed 50% normal pollen grains with I(2)-KI solution; however, those with both Rf5 and Rf6 displayed 75% normal pollens. We also established that the hybrid F(1) plants including both non-allelic restorer genes exhibited an increased stable seed setting when subjected to stress versus the F(1) plants with only one restorer gene. Finally, we discuss the breeding scheme for the plant gametophytic CMS/Rf system.
10.1023-A-1009601007175.pdf	A rapid PCR-aided selection of a rice line containing the Rf-1 gene which is involved in restoration of the cytoplasmic male sterility	1997	Molecular Breeding	Life Science Institute, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc., Togo 1144, Mobara, 297, Japan	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is widely known in higher plants, the mechanism of which is believed to involve incompatibility between nuclei and cytoplasms. In rice lines with the CMS trait, fertility is restored by the aid of a nuclear-encoded gene, Rf-1, whose locus has been determined in chromosome 10. We found a particular PCR-amplified fragment, designated fL601, that specifically amplified using the DNAs from Rf-1 lines tested as templates. RFLP mapping of the fL601 locus revealed that there are two loci for the fL601, and that both are tightly linked to the Rf-1 locus. Progeny analysis also showed high frequency of their co-segregation. Southern analysis of the genomic DNA demonstrated that the Rf-1 lines shared a unique sequence in the fL601 region. These results enabled us to construct a system for specific detection of the corresponding regions. Utilizing this detection system, we established a simple PCR-mediated selection method for the Rf-1 lines, which may facilitate the breeding for hybrid rice.
109.pdf	The rice pentatricopeptide repeat protein RF5 restores fertility in Hong-Lian cytoplasmic male-sterile lines via a complex with the glycine-rich protein GRP162	2012	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Plant Developmental Biology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.	The cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) phenotype in plants can be reversed by the action of nuclear-encoded fertility restorer (Rf) genes. The molecular mechanism involved in Rf gene-mediated processing of CMS-associated transcripts is unclear, as are the identities of other proteins that may be involved in the CMS-Rf interaction. In this study, we cloned the restorer gene Rf5 for Hong-Lian CMS in rice and studied its fertility restoration mechanism with respect to the processing of the CMS-associated transcript atp6-orfH79. RF5, a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein, was unable to bind to this CMS-associated transcript; however, a partner protein of RF5 (GRP162, a Gly-rich protein encoding 162 amino acids) was identified to bind to atp6-orfH79. GRP162 was found to physically interact with RF5 and to bind to atp6-orfH79 via an RNA recognition motif. Furthermore, we found that RF5 and GRP162 are both components of a restoration of fertility complex (RFC) that is 400 to 500 kD in size and can cleave CMS-associated transcripts in vitro. Evidence that a PPR protein interacts directly with a Gly-rich protein to form a subunit of the RFC provides a new perspective on the molecular mechanisms underlying fertility restoration.
g96-152.pdf	A codominant DNA marker closely linked to the rice nuclear restorer gene, RF-1, identified with inter-SSR fingerprinting	1996	Genome	Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Incorporated, Mobara, Japan.	A new molecular marker (OSRRf) closely linked to the nuclear restorer gene (Rf-1) for fertility in rice has been found. The Rf-1 gene is essential for hybrid rice seed production. A PCR-fingerprinting technique using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was applied to compare two near-isogenic lines with (MTC-10R) or without (MTC-10A) the Rf-1 gene. Of 76 inter-SSR primers tested, only one primer, (AG)8YC, generated polymorphisms. The tetranucleotide repeats generating polymorphisms were found within each amplicon. the genetic distance between OSRRf and Rf-1 was 3.7 +/- 1.1 cM. As in the case of a codominant marker, this marker will be applied not only to breeding both restorer lines and maintainer lines, but also to the purity management of hybrid rice seeds.
tpc1800676.pdf	Cytoplasmic male sterility of rice with boro II cytoplasm is caused by a cytotoxic peptide and is restored by two related PPR motif genes via distinct modes of mRNA silencing	2006	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Province, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and nucleus-controlled fertility restoration are widespread plant reproductive features that provide useful tools to exploit heterosis in crops. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this kind of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction remains unclear. Here, we show in rice (Oryza sativa) with Boro II cytoplasm that an abnormal mitochondrial open reading frame, orf79, is cotranscribed with a duplicated atp6 (B-atp6) gene and encodes a cytotoxic peptide. Expression of orf79 in CMS lines and transgenic rice plants caused gametophytic male sterility. Immunoblot analysis showed that the ORF79 protein accumulates specifically in microspores. Two fertility restorer genes, Rf1a and Rf1b, were identified at the classical locus Rf-1 as members of a multigene cluster that encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. RF1A and RF1B are both targeted to mitochondria and can restore male fertility by blocking ORF79 production via endonucleolytic cleavage (RF1A) or degradation (RF1B) of dicistronic B-atp6/orf79 mRNA. In the presence of both restorers, RF1A was epistatic over RF1B in the mRNA processing. We have also shown that RF1A plays an additional role in promoting the editing of atp6 mRNAs, independent of its cleavage function.
