Ubiquitin-Related Protein, RURM1	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Laboratory of Plant Breeding, Division of Agronomy and Horticultural Science, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan.	A rice ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (Rurm1) gene was cloned and transformed in Escherichia coli. We successfully expressed the RURM1 protein as a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein by cultivating the E. coli cells at 16 degrees C for 16 h. After cleavage of GST, we obtained a single protein of 12 kDa. This protein was identified as the RURM1 protein by western blot analysis.
