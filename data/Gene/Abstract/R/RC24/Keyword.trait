RC24	root	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
RC24	stem	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
RC24	growth	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 RC24 protein expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited chitinase activity and strongly inhibited bacterial growth
RC24	leaf	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 A basal level of RC24 transcripts was detected in rice root and stem tissues, but not in leaf tissues
RC24	leaf	Regulation, expression and function of a new basic chitinase gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 RC24 transcript accumulation was also observed in intact leaf tissues upon wounding, Transgenic rice plants containing the RC24/GUS gene fusion further confirmed that the RC24 gene showed a tissue-specific expression pattern and that transcription of the RC24 propmoter was sensitively and rapidly activated by wounding
