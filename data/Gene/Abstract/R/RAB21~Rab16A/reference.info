We have identified a novel rice gene, called RAB 21, which is induced when plants are subject to water-stress. This gene encodes a basic, glycine-rich protein (mol. wt 16,529) which has a duplicated domain structure. Immunoblots probed with antibodies raised against beta-galactosidase/RAB 21 fusion protein detect RAB 21 protein only in cytosolic cell fractions. RAB 21 mRNA and protein accumulate in rice embryos, leaves, roots and callus-derived suspension cells upon treatment with NaCl (200 mM) and/or the plant hormone abscisic acid (10 microM ABA). The effects of NaCl and ABA are not cumulative, suggesting that these two inducers share a common response pathway. Induction of RAB 21 mRNA accumulation by ABA is rapid (less than 15 min in suspension cells) and does not require protein synthesis, indicating that preformed nuclear and/or cytosolic factors mediate the response to this hormone. We have characterized the RAB 21 gene by determining the complete nucleotide sequence of a nearly full-length cDNA and corresponding genomic copy, and by mapping the start site of its major transcript. The proximal promoter region contains various GC-rich repeats.

MYB-type transcription factors (TFs) play essential roles in plant growth, development and respond to environmental stresses. Role of MYB-related TFs of rice in drought stress tolerance is not well documented. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel MYB-related TF, OsMYB48-1, of rice. Expression of OsMYB48-1 was strongly induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2, and dehydration, while being slightly induced by high salinity and cold treatment. The OsMYB48-1 protein was localized in the nucleus with transactivation activity at the C terminus. Overexpression of OsMYB48-1 in rice significantly improved tolerance to simulated drought and salinity stresses caused by mannitol, PEG, and NaCl, respectively, and drought stress was caused by drying the soil. In contrast to wild type plants, the overexpression lines exhibited reduced rate of water loss, lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline content under stress conditions. Moreover, overexpression plants were hypersensitive to ABA at both germination and post-germination stages and accumulated more endogenous ABA under drought stress conditions. Further studies demonstrated that overexpression of OsMYB48-1 could regulate the expression of some ABA biosynthesis genes (OsNCED4, OsNCED5), early signaling genes (OsPP2C68, OSRK1) and late responsive genes (RAB21, OsLEA3, RAB16C and RAB16D) under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results suggested that OsMYB48-1 functions as a novel MYB-related TF which plays a positive role in drought and salinity tolerance by regulating stress-induced ABA synthesis.
psb-7-502.pdf	Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance	2012	Plant Signal Behav	Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Laboratory, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India.	We report here the overexpression of Rab16A full length gene (promoter + ORF), from the salt-tolerant indica rice Pokkali, in the salt-susceptible indica rice variety Khitish, via particle bombardment. Molecular analysis of the transgenics revealed stable integration of the transgene upto T2 generation. High level of expression of the transgene (driven by its own stress-inducible promoter), as well as the protein, was detectable in the leaves under simulated salinity stress (250 mM NaCl, 24 h); the expression level being higher than wild type (WT) plants. The Rab16A transcript also increased gradually with seed maturity, with its maximal accumulation at 30 d after pollination (DAP) i.e., fully matured seeds, explaining the protective role of Rab16A gene during seed maturation. Enhanced tolerance to salinity was observed in the plants transformed with Rab16A. The superior physiological performances of the transgenics under salt treatment were also reflected in lesser shoot or root length inhibition, reduced chlorophyll damages, lesser accumulation of Na(+) and reduced loss of K(+), increased proline content as compared with the WT plants. All these results indicated that the overproduction of RAB16A protein in the transgenics enable them to display enhanced tolerance to salinity stress with improved physiological traits. Our work demonstrates the profound potential of Group 2 LEA proteins (to which RAB16A belongs to) in conferring stress tolerance in crop plants through their genetic manipulation.
