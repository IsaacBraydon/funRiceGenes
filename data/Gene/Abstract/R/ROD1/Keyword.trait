ROD1	resistance	Ca(2+) sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector.	 ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with agroecology-specific distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty
ROD1	yield	Ca(2+) sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector.

ROD1	immunity	Ca(2+) sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector.	 The fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence
ROD1	reactive oxygen species	Ca(2+) sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector.	 ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination
