D1|RGA1	RGB1	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 RGB1 knock-down lines were generated in the wild type and d1-5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit (Galpha) gene (RGA1)| Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5| The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	 Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	 Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses
