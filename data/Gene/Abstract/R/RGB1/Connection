D1|RGA1|LW5	RGB1|OsRGB1	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	RGB1 knock-down lines were generated in the wild type and d1-5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit (Galpha) gene (RGA1)
D1|RGA1|LW5	RGB1|OsRGB1	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5
D1|RGA1|LW5	RGB1|OsRGB1	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGB1|OsRGB1	Rice G-protein subunits qPE9-1 and RGB1 play distinct roles in abscisic acid responses and drought adaptation.	Taken together, it is proposed that RGB1 is a positive regulator of the ABA response and drought adaption in rice plants, whereas qPE9-1 is modulated by RGB1 and functions as a negative regulator in the ABA-dependent drought-stress responses
RGB1|OsRGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries
RGB1|OsRGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	 Marker-free transgenic IR64 rice lines that simultaneously overexpress both RGB1 and RGG1 genes under CaMV35S promoter were raised
RGB1|OsRGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	 Overall, the present study provides evidence that concurrent overexpression of G-protein subunits (RGG1 and RGB1) impart multiple (both biotic and abiotic) stress tolerance in rice which could be due to the enhanced expression of stress-marker genes and better management of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging/photosynthetic machinery

OsNF-YB1	RGB1|OsRGB1	RGB1 Regulates Grain Development and Starch Accumulation Through Its Effect on OsYUC11-Mediated Auxin Biosynthesis in Rice Endosperm Cells	 OsNF-YB1, which acts as a key downstream effector of RGB1, interacts directly with the promoter of OsYUC11 and stimulates the OsYUC11 expression, thereby regulating auxin biosynthesis and starch accumulation and grain size
