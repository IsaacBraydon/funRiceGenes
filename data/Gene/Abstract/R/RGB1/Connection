D1|RGA1	RGB1	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 RGB1 knock-down lines were generated in the wild type and d1-5, a mutant deficient for the heterotrimeric G protein alpha-subunit (Galpha) gene (RGA1)| Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5| The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
