RGB1	 Furthermore, the results suggested that qPE9-1 negatively regulates the ABA response by suppressing the expression of key transcription factors involved in ABA and stress responses, while RGB1 positively regulates ABA biosynthesis by upregulating NCED gene expression under both normal and drought stress conditions
RGB1	 Moreover, transcript profiling analysis revealed that the expression of a large number of auxin-, cytokinin-, and brassinosteroid-inducible genes was upregulated or downregulated in the rgb1 mutant compared to the wild type during seedling development
