RGB1	cellular proliferation	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 The RGB1 knock-down lines generated in d1-5 were shorter, suggesting RGB1 to be a positive regulator of cellular proliferation, in addition to RGA1
RGB1	seed	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock-down lines
RGB1	dwarf	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions
RGB1	lamina	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 Both transgenic lines showed browning of the lamina joint regions and nodes that could be attributed to a reduction of RGB1 function, as the abnormality was not observed in d1-5|Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions
RGB1	sterile	Suppression of the rice heterotrimeric G protein beta-subunit gene, RGB1, causes dwarfism and browning of internodes and lamina joint regions	 The number of sterile seeds also increased in both RGB1 knock-down lines
