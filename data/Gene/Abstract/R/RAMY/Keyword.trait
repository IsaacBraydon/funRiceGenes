RAMY	root	A new rice zinc-finger protein binds to the O2S box of the alpha-amylase gene promoter	 Low levels of RAMY mRNAs were detected in rice leaves and roots by Northern blot hybridization
RAMY	gibberellin	A new rice zinc-finger protein binds to the O2S box of the alpha-amylase gene promoter	 The plant hormone gibberellin (GA) induces expression of both RAMY and Amy2 genes, as performed by Northern blot hybridization, but the increase in RAMY mRNA level occurs prior to that of the Amy2 mRNA level in the GA-treated aleurone tissues
RAMY	transcription factor	A new rice zinc-finger protein binds to the O2S box of the alpha-amylase gene promoter	A putative transcription factor, named RAMY, that binds to the 20-bp O2S sequences of the regulatory region of the Amy2 gene promoter has been identified using the yeast one-hybrid system from a rice library
