Daily oscillations in Rdd1 expression were retained after transferring to continuous dark (DD) or light (LL) conditions, indicating circadian regulation. However, Rdd1 showed arrhythmic expression in etiolated coleoptiles. Experiments revealed that the Rdd1 transcript accumulated up to 1 h after transferring from DD to LL conditions and decreased thereafter. We examined Rdd1 expression using phytochrome (phy)-deficient mutants, and the results showed that phyA and most likely phyB contributed to the regulation of Rdd1 expression. To further examine the role of Rdd1, transgenic rice plants were produced that carried Rdd1 in either a sense (RDD1-S) or antisense (RDD1-AS) orientation, driven by a constitutive promoter. The expression of endogenous Rdd1 in response to far-red light was found to be modified in RDD1-AS plants compared with wild-type (WT) or RDD1-S plants. In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded. This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy-regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice.
NA	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	2016	Plant J	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	Fertilizers are often potential environmental pollutants; therefore, increasing productivity and the efficiency of nutrient uptake to boost crop yields without the risk of environmental pollution is a desirable goal. Here, we show that the transcription factor encoding gene RDD1 plays a role in improving the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions in rice. RDD1 was found to be targeted by the microRNA miR166. An RDD1 transgene driven by a strong constitutive promoter exhibited a diurnally oscillating expression similar to that of the endogenous RDD1, and nucleotide substitution within the miR166 recognition site to prevent miR166-RDD1 mRNA pairing resulted in constitutive RDD1 expression. The RDD1 protein was localized to vascular tissue because miR166 repressed RDD1 expression in the mesophyll. The overexpression of RDD1 induced the expression of genes associated with the transport of several nutrients such as NH4 (+) , Na(+) , SO4 (2-) , Cl(-) , PO4 (3-) and sucrose, and the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions under low-nutrient conditions. Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity. Our results suggest that RDD1 can contribute to the increased grain productivity of rice via inducing the efficient uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions.
