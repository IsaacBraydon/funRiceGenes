RDD1	 An RDD1 transgene driven by a strong constitutive promoter exhibited a diurnally oscillating expression similar to that of the endogenous RDD1, and nucleotide substitution within the miR166 recognition site to prevent miR166-RDD1 mRNA pairing resulted in constitutive RDD1 expression |  The RDD1 protein was localized to vascular tissue because miR166 repressed RDD1 expression in the mesophyll |  The overexpression of RDD1 induced the expression of genes associated with the transport of several nutrients such as NH4 (+) , Na(+) , SO4 (2-) , Cl(-) , PO4 (3-) and sucrose, and the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions under low-nutrient conditions |  Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity	 The overexpression of RDD1 induced the expression of genes associated with the transport of several nutrients such as NH4 (+) , Na(+) , SO4 (2-) , Cl(-) , PO4 (3-) and sucrose, and the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions under low-nutrient conditions |  Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity
