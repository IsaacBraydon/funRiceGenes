RDD1	flower	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice	 In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded
RDD1	grain	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice	 In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded| This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy-regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice|Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice

RDD1	transcription factor	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice	We report here on the characterization of a putative Dof transcription factor gene in rice (Oryza sativa)--rice Dof daily fluctuations 1 (Rdd1)
RDD1	grain	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	 Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity
RDD1	grain	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	 Our results suggest that RDD1 can contribute to the increased grain productivity of rice via inducing the efficient uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions
RDD1	nitrogen	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	 Moreover, the overexpression of RDD1 increased nitrogen responsiveness and grain productivity
RDD1	transcription factor	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.
RDD1	transcription factor	MicroRNA-targeted transcription factor gene RDD1 promotes nutrient ion uptake and accumulation in rice.	 Here, we show that the transcription factor encoding gene RDD1 plays a role in improving the uptake and accumulation of various nutrient ions in rice
