RDD1	flower	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice	 In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded
RDD1	grain	Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice	 In addition, RDD1-AS plants were smaller and flowered later than WT or RDD1-S plants; decreases in grain length, width and 1000-grain weight were also recorded| This study demonstrates that Rdd1 is a circadian clock and phy-regulated gene, which is associated with grain size in rice|Circadian clock- and phytochrome-regulated Dof-like gene, Rdd1, is associated with grain size in rice
