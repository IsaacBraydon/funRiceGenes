OsCR4	OsSAL1|RHL	Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice	Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF

OsSAL1|RHL	Sdt97	Sdt97, a Point Mutation in 5' Untranslated Region, Confers Semi-dwarfism in Rice.	Using a residual heterozygous line (RHL) population, Sdt97 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6 at the interval nearly 60 kb between STS marker N6 and SNP marker N16 within the PAC clone P0453H04
