A plant homolog of yeast HAL2 gene (RHL) was cloned from rice (Orizya sativa L.). The RHL cDNA complemented an Escherichia coli cysteine auxotrophic mutant, cysQ, and the yeast HAL2 mutant, met22. The latter is a methionine auxotroph and cannot use sulfate, sulfite, or sulfide as sulfur sources but exhibits wild-type activities of the enzymes necessary to assimilate sulfate and has normal sulfur uptake system. These results demonstrated that HAL2, cysQ, and RHL genes encode proteins with similar function in sulfur assimilatory pathway. The RHL cDNA expressed a 40-kDa protein that was shown to catalyze the conversion of adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) to adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3'(2')-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) to AMP. The enzyme activity is Mg(2+)-dependent, sensitive to Ca2+, Li+, and Na+ and activated by K+. The inhibition by Ca2+ depends on the Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio and is reversible by high Mg2+ concentration. The substrate specificity and kinetics of RHL enzyme are very similar to the Chlorella 3'(2'),5'-diphosphonucleoside 3'(2')-phosphohydrolase (DPNPase). Our evidence suggests that this enzyme regulates the flux of sulfur in the sulfur-activation pathway by converting PAPS to APS. Several residues that are essential for the activity of this enzyme were identified by site-directed mutagenesis, and the possible role of DPNPase in salt tolerance is discussed.

The rice (Oryza sativa L.) basic leucine Zipper factor RISBZ1 and rice prolamin box binding factor (RPBF) are transcriptional activators of rice seed storage protein (SSP) genes in vivo. To ascertain the functions of these trans-activators in seed development, knock-down (KD) transgenic rice plants were generated in which the accumulation of RISBZ1 and RPBF was reduced in an endosperm-specific manner by co-suppression (KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RPBF). The accumulation of most SSPs changed little between individual KD mutants and wild-type plants, whereas a double KD mutant (KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF) resulted in a significant reduction of most SSP gene expression and accumulation. The reduction of both trans-activators also caused a greater reduction in seed starch accumulation than individual KD mutants. Storage lipids were accumulated at reduced levels in KD-RISBZ1 and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds. KD-RPBF and KD-RISBZ1/KD-RPBF seeds exhibited multi-layered aleurone cells. Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF. These phenotypes suggest that combinatorial interactions between RISBZ1 and RPBF play an essential role during grain filling. The functional redundancy and compensation between RISBZ1 and RPBF possibly account for weak effects on the SSP levels in single KD mutants, and help maintain various processes during seed development in rice. Physical interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF may ensure that these processes are carried out properly.
PNAS-2003-Shen-6552-7.pdf	sal1 determines the number of aleurone cell layers in maize endosperm and encodes a class E vacuolar sorting protein	2003	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Johnston, IA 50131, USA.	A microscopy-based screen of a large collection of maize Mutator (Mu) transposon lines identified the supernumerary aleurone layers 1-1 (sal1-1) mutant line carrying up to seven layers of aleurone cells in defective kernel endosperm compared with only a single layer in wild-type grains. Normal, well filled endosperm that is homozygous for the sal1-1 mutant allele contains two to three layers of aleurone cells. Cloning of the sal1 gene was accomplished by using Mu tagging, and the identity of the cloned gene was confirmed by isolating an independent sal1-2 allele by reverse genetics. Homozygous sal1-2 endosperm has two to three layers of aleurone cells in normal, well filled grains. In situ hybridization experiments reveal that the sal1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in vegetative as well as zygotic grain tissues, with no difference being detected between aleurone cells and starchy endosperm cells. Northern blot analysis failed to detect the sal1-2 transcript in leaves of homozygous plants, suggesting that the allele is a true sal1 knockout allele. The sal1 gene encodes a homologue of the human Chmp1 gene, a member of the conserved family of the class E vacuolar protein sorting genes implicated in membrane vesicle trafficking. In mammals, CHMP1 functions in the pathway targeting plasma membrane receptors and ligands to lysosomes for proteolytic degradation. Possible roles for the function of the sal1 gene in aleurone signaling, including a defect in endosome trafficking, are discussed.
