Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with jasmonic acid (JA) for 1/2h yielded a cDNA of a gene tentatively named RERJ1 that is upregulated in response to exogenous JA. Northern blot analysis indicated that the RERJ1 mRNA levels peaked at 1/2-1h after the addition of jasmonic acid and then decreased gradually. RERJ1 encodes a transcriptional regulator with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. The phenotypes of transgenic rice plants overexpressing sense or antisense RERJ1 mRNA demonstrated that RERJ1 is involved in the growth inhibition of rice shoots caused by JA. Other biological functions of RERJ1 are discussed from an evolutionary standpoint.

We previously reported that RERJ1, a JA-inducible transcription factor in rice, is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress. Here, we demonstrated that the expression of RERJ1 after wounding is regulated in a JA-dependent manner in rice, based on histochemical analysis of RERJ1 promoter-GUS transgenic plants. RERJ1 expression was induced only at the region of injury after wounding, whereas expression was induced in the entire leaf after drought. According to JA measurements of stressed leaves, high accumulation of endogenous JA was only detected around the wound site in a rice leaves, whereas the drought treatment led to uniform accumulation of JA in the entire leaf, suggesting that RERJ1 will be a useful marker gene for studies on localization of JA in rice. Nuclear localization and transactivation ability of RERJ1 were also demonstrated. These results suggest that RERJ1 plays a role as a transcriptional activator for regulating stress-inducible gene expression, with a strong correlation to JA accumulation in the stressed region.
69_1042.pdf	Involvement of the Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor RERJ1 in Wounding and Drought Stress Responses in Rice Plants	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo	The jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene RERJ1 isolated from suspension-cultured rice cells encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. In this study, we found that RERJ1 is also expressed in rice plants in response to JA, and that its expression in rice leaves is up-regulated by exposure to wounding and drought stress. It is also suggested that JA but not abscisic acid is involved in the up-regulation of RERJ1 expression caused by wounding and drought stress.
NA	A bHLH transcription activator regulates defense signaling by nucleo-cytosolic trafficking in rice.	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Crosstalk between plant hormone signaling pathways is vital for controlling the immune response during pathogen invasion. Salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) often play important but antagonistic roles in the immune responses of higher plants. Here, we identify a basic helix-loop-helix transcription activator, OsbHLH6, which confers disease resistance in rice by regulating SA and JA signaling via nucleo-cytosolic trafficking in rice (Oryza sativa). OsbHLH6 expression was upregulated during Magnaporthe oryzae infection. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsbHLH6 display increased JA responsive gene expression and enhanced disease susceptibility to the pathogen. Nucleus-localized OsbHLH6 activates JA signaling and suppresses SA signaling; however, the SA regulator OsNPR1 (Nonexpressor of PR genes 1) sequesters OsbHLH6 in the cytosol to alleviate its effect. Our data suggest that OsbHLH6 controls disease resistance by dynamically regulating SA and JA signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
