OsNPR1|NH1	RERJ1|OsOsbHLH006|OsbHLH6	A bHLH transcription activator regulates defense signaling by nucleo-cytosolic trafficking in rice.	 Nucleus-localized OsbHLH6 activates JA signaling and suppresses SA signaling; however, the SA regulator OsNPR1 (Nonexpressor of PR genes 1) sequesters OsbHLH6 in the cytosol to alleviate its effect
