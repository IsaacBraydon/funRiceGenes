Heterotrimeric G proteins, which consist of G¦Á , G¦Â and G¦Ã subunits, function as molecular switches to regulate a wide range of developmental processes in plants. In this study, we characterize the function of rice RGG2, which encodes a type B G¦Ã subunit, in grain size and yield production. The expression levels of RGG2 are significantly higher than those of other rice G¦Ã -encoding genes in all tissues tested, suggesting that RGG2 plays essential roles in rice growth and development. By regulating cell expansion, RGG2 overexpression in Nipponbare (NIP) leads to reduced plant height and decreased grain size. By contrast, two mutants generated by the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9) system in the Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) background, zrgg2-1 and zrgg2-2, exhibit enhanced growth, including elongated internodes, increased 1000-grain weight and plant biomass, and enhanced grain yield per plant (+11.8% and 16.0%, respectively). These results demonstrate that RGG2 acts as a negative regulator of plant growth and organ size in rice. By measuring the length of the second leaf sheath after gibberellin (GA3 ) treatment and the GA-induced ¦Á-amylase activity of seeds, we found that RGG2 is also involved in GA signaling. In summary, we propose that RGG2 may regulate grain and organ size via the GA pathway and that manipulation of RGG2 provides a novel strategy for rice grain yield enhancement.
