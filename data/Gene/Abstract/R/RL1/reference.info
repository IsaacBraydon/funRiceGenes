NA	RADICLELESS 1 (RL1)-mediated nad4 intron 1 splicing is crucial for embryo and endosperm development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China.	Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are one of the largest protein families in land plants. PPR proteins exhibit sequence-specific RNA-binding activity and are implicated in plant growth and development related processes. In this study, we report that the radicleless 1 (rl1) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.) exhibited defective radicle emergence in embryos and compromised grain filling in endosperms. Gene cloning and confirmation via genetic complementation analyses showed that RL1 encodes a P-type PPR protein, which is localized to mitochondria. The RL1 protein was specifically involved in the splicing of intron 1 of the mitochondrial nad4 transcript, which encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex. Consistent with this observation, the rl1 mutant exhibited altered mitochondrial morphology and lower ATP accumulation compared with the wild type. Thus, our findings suggest that RL1-mediated nad4 splicing is crucial for embryo and endosperm development in rice.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
