RPA1c	RPA2c	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice	Furthermore, we identified RPA1c, an RPA1 subunit with nearly overlapping distribution to RPA2c, required for ~79% of chiasmata formation
RPA1c	RPA2c	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice	Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice
