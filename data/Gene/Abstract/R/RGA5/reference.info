j.1365-313X.2011.04502.x.pdf	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes	2011	Plant J	Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Kitakami, Iwate 024-0003, Japan.	The Oryza sativa (rice) resistance gene Pia confers resistance to the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae carrying the AVR-Pia avirulence gene. To clone Pia, we employed a multifaceted genomics approach. First, we selected 12 R-gene analog (RGA) genes encoding nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeats (NBS-LRRs) proteins from a region on chromosome 11 that shows linkage to Pia. By using seven rice accessions, we examined the association between Pia phenotypes and DNA polymorphisms in the 10 genes, which revealed three genes (Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5) exhibiting a perfect association with the Pia phenotypes. We also screened ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS)-treated mutant lines of the rice cultivar 'Sasanishiki' harboring Pia, and isolated two mutants that lost the Pia phenotype. DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4. The wild-type 'Sasanishiki' allele of Os11gRGA4 (SasRGA4) complemented Pia function in both mutants, suggesting that SasRGA4 is necessary for Pia function. However, when the rice cultivar 'Himenomochi' lacking Pia was transfected with SasRGA4, the Pia phenotype was not recovered. An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function. A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection.
Plant Cell-2013-Cesari-tpc.112.107201.pdf	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	2013	Plant Cell	INRA, UMR 385 Biologie et Genetique des Interactions Plante-Parasite, F-34398 Montpellier, France.	Resistance (R) proteins recognize pathogen avirulence (Avr) proteins by direct or indirect binding and are multidomain proteins generally carrying a nucleotide binding (NB) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39. RGA4 and RGA5 also mediate recognition of the unrelated M. oryzae effector AVR-Pia, indicating that the corresponding R proteins possess dual recognition specificity. For RGA5, two alternative transcripts, RGA5-A and RGA5-B, were identified. Genetic analysis showed that only RGA5-A confers resistance, while RGA5-B is inactive. Yeast two-hybrid, coimmunoprecipitation, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging experiments revealed direct binding of AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 to RGA5-A, providing evidence for the recognition of multiple Avr proteins by direct binding to a single R protein. Direct binding seems to be required for resistance as an inactive AVR-Pia allele did not bind RGA5-A. A small Avr interaction domain with homology to the Avr recognition domain in the rice R protein Pik-1 was identified in the C terminus of RGA5-A. This reveals a mode of Avr protein recognition through direct binding to a novel, non-LRR interaction domain.
NA	Ectopic activation of the rice NLR heteropair RGA4/RGA5 confers resistance to bacterial blight and bacterial leaf streak diseases.	2016	Plant J	UMR Interactions Plantes-Microorganismes-Environnement, IRD-Cirad-UM, Montpellier, France.	Bacterial Blight (BB) and Bacterial Leaf Streak (BLS) are important rice diseases caused, respectively, by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc). In both bacteria, Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effectors are major virulence determinants that act by transactivating host genes downstream of Effector-Binding Elements (EBEs) bound in a sequence specific manner. Resistance to Xoo is mostly related to TAL effectors action, either by polymorphisms that prevent induction of susceptibility (S) genes or by executor (R) genes with EBEs embedded in their promoter and that induce cell death and resistance. For Xoc, no resistance sources are known in rice. Here, we investigated whether the recognition of effectors by nucleotide-binding and leucine rich repeat domain immune receptors (NLRs), the most widespread resistance mechanism in plants, is also able to stop BB and BLS. In one instance, transgenic rice lines harboring the AVR1-CO39 effector gene from the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, under the control of an inducible promoter, were challenged with transgenic Xoo and Xoc strains carrying a TAL effector designed to transactivate the inducible promoter. This induced AVR1-CO39 expression and triggered BB and BLS resistance when the corresponding Pi-CO39 resistance locus was present. In a second example, transactivation of an auto-active NLR by Xoo-delivered designer TAL effectors resulted in BB resistance, demonstrating that NLR-triggered immune responses efficiently control Xoo. This forms the foundation for future BB and BLS disease control strategies whereupon endogenous TAL effectors will target synthetic promoter regions of Avr or NLR executor genes.

NA	Recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia by the decoy domain of the rice NLR immune receptor RGA5.	2017	Plant Cell	INRA, BGPI, Biology and Genetics of Plant-Pathogen Interactions CITY: Montpellier France [FR].	Nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs) are important receptors in plant immunity that allow recognition of pathogen effectors. The rice NLR RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia through direct interaction. Here, we gained detailed insights into the molecular and structural bases of AVR-Pia-RGA5 interaction and the role of the RATX1 decoy domain of RGA5. NMR titration combined with in vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction analyses identified the AVR-Pia interaction surface that binds to the RATX1 domain. Structure-informed AVR-Pia mutants showed that, although AVR-Pia associates with additional sites in RGA5, binding to the RATX1 domain is necessary for pathogen recognition, but can be of moderate affinity. Therefore, RGA5-mediated resistance is highly resilient to mutations in the effector. We propose a model that explains such robust effector recognition as a consequence, and an advantage, of the combination of integrated decoy domains with additional independent effector-NLR interactions.
NA	A designer rice NLR immune receptor confers resistance to the rice blast fungus carrying noncorresponding avirulence effectors.	2021	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, China.	Plant nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors recognize avirulence effectors directly through their integrated domains (IDs) or indirectly via the effector-targeted proteins. Previous studies have succeeded in generating designer NLR receptors with new recognition profiles by engineering IDs or targeted proteins based on prior knowledge of their interactions with the effectors. However, it is yet a challenge to design a new plant receptor capable of recognizing effectors that function by unknown mechanisms. Several rice NLR immune receptors, including RGA5, possess an integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain that recognizes corresponding Magnaporthe oryzae Avrs and ToxB-like (MAX) effectors in the rice blast fungus. Here, we report a designer rice NLR receptor RGA5(HMA2) carrying an engineered, integrated HMA domain (RGA5-HMA2) that can recognize the noncorresponding MAX effector AvrPib and confers the RGA4-dependent resistance to the M. oryzae isolates expressing AvrPib, which originally triggers the Pib-mediated blast resistance via unknown mechanisms. The RGA5-HMA2 domain is contrived based on the high structural similarity of AvrPib with two MAX effectors, AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39, recognized by cognate RGA5-HMA, the binding interface between AVR1-CO39 and RGA5-HMA, and the distinct surface charge of AvrPib and RAG5-HMA. This work demonstrates that rice NLR receptors with the HMA domain can be engineered to confer resistance to the M. oryzae isolates noncorresponding but structurally similar MAX effectors, which manifest cognate NLR receptor-mediated resistance with unknown mechanisms. Our study also provides a practical approach for developing rice multilines and broad race spectrum-resistant cultivars by introducing a series of engineered NLR receptors.
