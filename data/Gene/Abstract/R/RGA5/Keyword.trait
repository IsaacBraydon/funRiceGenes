RGA5	magnaporthe oryzae	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39
RGA5	magnaporthe oryzae	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding
RGA5	magnaporthe oryzae	Recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia by the decoy domain of the rice NLR immune receptor RGA5.	The rice NLR RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR-Pia through direct interaction
RGA5	magnaporthe oryzae	New recognition specificity in a plant immune receptor by molecular engineering of its integrated domain.	 We relied for this on detailed knowledge on the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-PikD, AVR-Pia, and AVR1-CO39 by, respectively, the rice NLRs Pikp-1 and RGA5
