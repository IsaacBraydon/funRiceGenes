RGA4	RGA5	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes	DNA sequencing of Os11gRGA3-Os11gRGA5 from the two mutant lines identified independent mutations of major effects in Os11gRGA4
RGA4	RGA5	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes	An additional complementation study revealed that the two NBS-LRR-type R genes, SasRGA4 and SasRGA5, that are located next to each other and oriented in the opposite direction are necessary for Pia function
RGA4	RGA5	A multifaceted genomics approach allows the isolation of the rice Pia-blast resistance gene consisting of two adjacent NBS-LRR protein genes	A population genetics analysis of SasRGA4 and SasRGA5 suggests that the two genes are under long-term balancing selection
RGA4	RGA5	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	Two NB-LRR protein-coding genes from rice (Oryza sativa), RGA4 and RGA5, were found to be required for the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effector AVR1-CO39
RGA4	RGA5	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	RGA4 and RGA5 also mediate recognition of the unrelated M
RGA4	RGA5	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding	The rice resistance protein pair RGA4/RGA5 recognizes the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 by direct binding
Pikp-1	RGA5	New recognition specificity in a plant immune receptor by molecular engineering of its integrated domain.	 We relied for this on detailed knowledge on the recognition of the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR-PikD, AVR-Pia, and AVR1-CO39 by, respectively, the rice NLRs Pikp-1 and RGA5
RGA4	RGA5	The activity of the RGA5 sensor NLR from rice requires binding of its integrated HMA domain to effectors but not HMA domain self-interaction.	The rice nucleotide-binding (NB) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain immune receptors (NLRs) RGA4 and RGA5 form a helper NLR/sensor NLR (hNLR/sNLR) pair that specifically recognizes the effectors AVR-Pia and AVR1-CO39 from the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae
RGA4	RGA5	The activity of the RGA5 sensor NLR from rice requires binding of its integrated HMA domain to effectors but not HMA domain self-interaction.	 While RGA4 contains only canonical NLR domains, RGA5 has an additional unconventional heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain integrated after its LRR domain
