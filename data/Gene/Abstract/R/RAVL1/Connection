D11|CPB1|CYP724B1|GNS4|PMM1	RAVL1	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11	RAVL1	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
OsEIL1|MHZ6	RAVL1	RAVL1, an upstream component of brassinosteroid signaling and biosynthesis, regulates ethylene signaling via activation of EIL1 in rice.	RAVL1, an upstream component of brassinosteroid signaling and biosynthesis, regulates ethylene signaling via activation of EIL1 in rice.
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11	RAVL1	RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.	 Mutants d61-1 and d2 were less susceptible to sheath blight disease, bri1-D was more susceptible, and ravl1 and d61-1/EIL1 Ri5 were similarly susceptible compared to WT
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11	RAVL1	RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.	 BRI1 and D2 expression in EIL1 Ri5/RAVL1 OX and EIL1 expression in d61-1/RAVL1 OX, indicated that RAVL1 activates BRI1/D2 and EIL1, respectively, independent of BR and ethylene signaling
