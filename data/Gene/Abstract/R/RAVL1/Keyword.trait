RAVL1	BR signaling	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis
RAVL1	homeostasis	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis
RAVL1	homeostasis	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
RAVL1	 BR 	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor
RAVL1	 BR 	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
RAVL1	 BR 	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis

RAVL1	root	Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1) regulates brassinosteroid-mediated activation of AMT1;2 in rice (Oryza sativa).	Moreover, (15)NH4(+) uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels
