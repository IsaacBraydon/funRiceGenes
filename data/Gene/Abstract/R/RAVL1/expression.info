RAVL1	 We then employed Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1), which is involved in BR homeostasis, to investigate BR-mediated AMT1 expression and its effect on NH4(+) uptake in rice roots |  AMT1;2 expression was lower in the ravl1 mutant, but higher in the RAVL1-overexpressing lines |  EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that RAVL1 activates the expression of AMT1;2 by directly binding to E-box motifs in its promoter |  Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2	 Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2
