Temporal and spatial variation in the levels of and sensitivity to hormones are essential for the development of higher organisms. Traditionally, end-product feedback regulation has been considered as the key mechanism for the achievement of cellular homeostasis. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive1. Binding of these hormones to the receptor activates BR signaling and eventually suppresses BR synthesis. This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor. Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback. Activation by RAVL1 was coordinated via E-box cis-elements in the promoters of the receptor and biosynthetic genes. Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis. Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis. This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways.
NA	Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1) regulates brassinosteroid-mediated activation of AMT1;2 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Exp Bot	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Dongling Road 120, Shenyang 110866, China cdhan@gsnu.ac.kr.	The promotive effects of brassinosteroids (BRs) on plant growth and development have been widely investigated; however, it is not known whether BRs directly affect nutrient uptake. Here, we explored the possibility of a direct relationship between BRs and ammonium uptake via AMT1-type genes in rice (Oryza sativa). BR treatment increased the expression of AMT1;1 and AMT1;2, whereas in the mutant d61-1, which is defective in the BR-receptor gene BRI1, BR-dependent expression of these genes was suppressed. We then employed Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1), which is involved in BR homeostasis, to investigate BR-mediated AMT1 expression and its effect on NH4(+) uptake in rice roots. AMT1;2 expression was lower in the ravl1 mutant, but higher in the RAVL1-overexpressing lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that RAVL1 activates the expression of AMT1;2 by directly binding to E-box motifs in its promoter. Moreover, (15)NH4(+) uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels. Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2. Thus, the present study shows how BRs may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of nutrient transporters to modulate their uptake capacity.
