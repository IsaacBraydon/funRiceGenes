Temporal and spatial variation in the levels of and sensitivity to hormones are essential for the development of higher organisms. Traditionally, end-product feedback regulation has been considered as the key mechanism for the achievement of cellular homeostasis. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are perceived by the cell surface receptor kinase Brassinosteroid Insensitive1. Binding of these hormones to the receptor activates BR signaling and eventually suppresses BR synthesis. This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor. Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback. Activation by RAVL1 was coordinated via E-box cis-elements in the promoters of the receptor and biosynthetic genes. Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis. Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis. This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways.
NA	Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1) regulates brassinosteroid-mediated activation of AMT1;2 in rice (Oryza sativa).	2016	J Exp Bot	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Dongling Road 120, Shenyang 110866, China cdhan@gsnu.ac.kr.	The promotive effects of brassinosteroids (BRs) on plant growth and development have been widely investigated; however, it is not known whether BRs directly affect nutrient uptake. Here, we explored the possibility of a direct relationship between BRs and ammonium uptake via AMT1-type genes in rice (Oryza sativa). BR treatment increased the expression of AMT1;1 and AMT1;2, whereas in the mutant d61-1, which is defective in the BR-receptor gene BRI1, BR-dependent expression of these genes was suppressed. We then employed Related to ABI3/VP1-Like 1 (RAVL1), which is involved in BR homeostasis, to investigate BR-mediated AMT1 expression and its effect on NH4(+) uptake in rice roots. AMT1;2 expression was lower in the ravl1 mutant, but higher in the RAVL1-overexpressing lines. EMSA and ChIP analyses showed that RAVL1 activates the expression of AMT1;2 by directly binding to E-box motifs in its promoter. Moreover, (15)NH4(+) uptake, cellular ammonium contents, and root responses to methyl-ammonium strongly depended on RAVL1 levels. Analysing AMT1;2 expression levels in different crosses between BRI1 and RAVL1 mutant and overexpression lines indicated that RAVL1 acts downstream of BRI1 in the regulation of AMT1;2. Thus, the present study shows how BRs may be involved in the transcriptional regulation of nutrient transporters to modulate their uptake capacity.
NA	RAVL1, an upstream component of brassinosteroid signaling and biosynthesis, regulates ethylene signaling via activation of EIL1 in rice.	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110866, China.	Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones that regulate several aspects of plant growth and development. Their signal is activated by the binding of BRs to the receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), which activates the transcription factors BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) and BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) that regulate target gene expression (Kim and Wang, 2010). More recently, the crosstalk between BRs and other hormone signaling factors has been extensively investigated, and it has been suggested that BR signaling is highly integrated with other signals to regulate plant growth and development (Wang et<U+00A0>al, 2012).

NA	RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.	2018	Phytopathology	College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Department of Plant Pathology, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China ; dpyuan@outlook.com.	Rhizoctonia solani causes sheath blight disease in rice; however, the defense mechanism of rice plants against R. solani remains elusive. To analyze the roles of brassinosteroid (BR) and ethylene signaling on rice defense to R. solani, wild-type (WT) rice and several mutants and over-expressing (OX) lines were inoculated with R. solani. Mutants d61-1 and d2 were less susceptible to sheath blight disease, bri1-D was more susceptible, and ravl1 and d61-1/EIL1 Ri5 were similarly susceptible compared to WT. The double mutant ravl1/d61-1 was phenotypically similar to the ravl1 mutant. Transcriptome analysis, ChIP, EMSA, and transient assays indicted that RAVL1 might directly activate Ethylene insensitive 3-like 1 (EIL1), a master regulator of ethylene signaling. Mutants ers1 and d61-1/RAVL1 OX were resistant to sheath blight disease, whereas EIL1 RNAi mutants and RAVL1 OX were more susceptible than WT. BRI1 and D2 expression in EIL1 Ri5/RAVL1 OX and EIL1 expression in d61-1/RAVL1 OX, indicated that RAVL1 activates BRI1/D2 and EIL1, respectively, independent of BR and ethylene signaling. Our analyses provide information on how BR and ethylene signaling regulate sheath blight disease and on the regulatory function of RAVL1 in rice sheath blight disease.
