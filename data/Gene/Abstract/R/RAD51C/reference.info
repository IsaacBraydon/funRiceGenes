ers190.pdf	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	2012	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The RecA/RAD51 family of rice (Oryza sativa) consists of at least 13 members. However, the functions of most of these members are unknown. Here the functional characterization of one member of this family, RAD51C, is reported. Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice. Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility. Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs). PMCs had an absence of normal pachytene chromosomes and had abnormal chromosome fragments. The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development. However, the RAD51C-KO line was sensitive to different DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells.
NA	OsRAD51D promotes homologous pairing and recombination by preventing nonhomologous interactions in rice meiosis 	2020	New Phytol.	  State Key Lab of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China.	Homologous recombination is carefully orchestrated to maintain genome integrity. RAD51D has been previously shown to be essential for double-strand break repair in mammalian somatic cells. However, the function of RAD51D during meiosis is largely unknown. Here, through detailed analyses of Osrad51d single and double mutants, we pinpoint the specific function of OsRAD51D in coordinating homologous pairing and recombination by preventing nonhomologous interactions during meiosis. OsRAD51D is associated with telomeres in both meiocytes and somatic cells. Loss of OsRAD51D leads to significant induction of nonhomologous pairing and chromosome entanglements, suggesting its role in suppressing nonhomologous interactions. The failed localization of OsRAD51 and OsDMC1 in Osrad51d, together with the genetic analysis of Osrad51d Osdmc1a Osdmc1b, indicates that OsRAD51D acts at a very early stage of homologous recombination. Observations from the Osrad51d pair1 and Osrad51d ku70 double mutants further demonstrate that nonhomologous interactions require double-strand break formation but do not depend on the KU70-mediated repair pathway. Moreover, the interplay between OsRAD51D and OsRAD51C indicates both conservation and divergence of their functions in meiosis. Altogether, this work reveals that OsRAD51D plays an essential role in the inhibition of nonhomologous connections, thus guaranteeing faithful pairing and recombination during meiosis.
