RAD51C	XRCC3	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
MOF	RAD51C	MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double Strand Break Repair in Rice.	The recruitment of Completion of meiosis I (COM1) and Radiation sensitive51C (RAD51C) to DSBs is severely compromised in mutant meiocytes, indicating that MOF is crucial for DSB end-processing and repair
