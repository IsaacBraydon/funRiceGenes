RAD51C	meiosis	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
RAD51C	meiosis	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells
RAD51C	fertility	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility
RAD51C	reproductive	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
RAD51C	anther	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
RAD51C	mitosis	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
RAD51C	pollen	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
RAD51C	meiotic	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
RAD51C	vegetative	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
RAD51C	sterility	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice
RAD51C	sterility	The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells	Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
RAD51C	meiotic	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	 Here, through targeted disruption of RAD51C and RAD51D, we generated three new mutants and revealed their later meiotic role in crossover maturation
RAD51C	crossover	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	 Here, through targeted disruption of RAD51C and RAD51D, we generated three new mutants and revealed their later meiotic role in crossover maturation
RAD51C	crossover	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	 Reductions in chiasma frequency and later HEI10 foci in these mutants support that crossover maturation requires RAD51C and RAD51D
RAD51C	homologous recombination	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	 RAD51C and RAD51D play an early role in facilitating RAD51 during homologous recombination
RAD51C	recombination	RAD51C-RAD51D interplays with MSH5 and regulates crossover maturation in rice meiosis.	 RAD51C and RAD51D play an early role in facilitating RAD51 during homologous recombination
