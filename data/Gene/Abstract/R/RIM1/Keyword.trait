RIM1	disease	Disruption of a novel gene for a NAC-domain protein in rice confers resistance to Rice dwarf virus	One mutant, designated rim1-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV
RIM1	jasmonate	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	These results suggest that RIM1 may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway
RIM1	jasmonate	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling
RIM1	 ja 	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	Here, we report that RIM1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of JA signaling and is degraded in response to JA treatment via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway
RIM1	 ja 	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	The expression profiles of the mutants were significantly correlated with those of JA-treated wild-type plants without accumulation of endogenous JA, indicating that RIM1 functions as a component of JA signaling
RIM1	 ja 	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	The expression of genes encoding JA biosynthetic enzymes (lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase 2 (AOS2) and OPDA reductase 7 (OPR7)) was up-regulated in the rim1 mutants under normal conditions, and a rapid and massive accumulation of endogenous JA was detected in the mutants after wounding
RIM1	 ja 	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	These results suggest that RIM1 may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway
RIM1	dwarf	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	We recently identified the NAC transcription factor RIM1 as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV)
RIM1	root	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	Plants carrying rim1 mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition
RIM1	growth	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	Plants carrying rim1 mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition
RIM1	leaf	Disruption of a novel gene for a NAC-domain protein in rice confers resistance to Rice dwarf virus	The rim1-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant
RIM1	transcription factor	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	We recently identified the NAC transcription factor RIM1 as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV)
RIM1	transcription factor	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling
