NYC1	RIM1|ONAC054	Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound ONAC054 is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.	 Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly downregulated in onac054 mutants
NYC1	RIM1|ONAC054	Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound ONAC054 is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays showed that ONAC054 directly activates OsABI5 and NYC1 by binding to the mitochondrial dysfunction motif in their promoters
