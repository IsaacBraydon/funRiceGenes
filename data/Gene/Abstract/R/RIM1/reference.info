Rice dwarf virus (RDV) is a serious viral pest that is transmitted to rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) by leafhoppers and causes a dwarfism in infected plants. To identify host factors involved in the multiplication of RDV, we screened Tos17 insertion mutant lines of rice for mutants with reduced susceptibility to RDV. One mutant, designated rim1-1, did not show typical disease symptoms upon infection with RDV. The accumulation of RDV capsid proteins was also drastically reduced in inoculated rim1-1 mutant plants. Co-segregation and complementation analyses revealed that the rim1-1 mutation had been caused by insertion of Tos17 in an intron of a novel NAC gene. The rim1-1 mutant remained susceptible to the two other viruses tested, one of which is also transmitted by leafhoppers, suggesting that the multiplication rather than transmission of RDV is specifically impaired in this mutant. We propose that RIM1 functions as a host factor that is required for multiplication of RDV in rice.
j.1365-313X.2009.04107.x.pdf	The NAC transcription factor RIM1 of rice is a new regulator of jasmonate signaling	2010	Plant J	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	Jasmonates (JAs) are lipid-derived regulators that play crucial roles in both host immunity and development. We recently identified the NAC transcription factor RIM1 as a host factor involved in multiplication of rice dwarf virus (RDV). Here, we report that RIM1 functions as a transcriptional regulator of JA signaling and is degraded in response to JA treatment via a 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. Plants carrying rim1 mutations show a phenotype of root growth inhibition. The expression profiles of the mutants were significantly correlated with those of JA-treated wild-type plants without accumulation of endogenous JA, indicating that RIM1 functions as a component of JA signaling. The expression of genes encoding JA biosynthetic enzymes (lipoxygenase (LOX), allene oxide synthase 2 (AOS2) and OPDA reductase 7 (OPR7)) was up-regulated in the rim1 mutants under normal conditions, and a rapid and massive accumulation of endogenous JA was detected in the mutants after wounding. These results suggest that RIM1 may represent a new molecular link in jasmonate signaling, and may thereby provide new insights into the well-established coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1)-Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) JA signaling pathway.
