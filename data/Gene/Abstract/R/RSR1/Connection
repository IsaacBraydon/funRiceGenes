OsSRT1	RSR1|qHD5	OsSRT1 is involved in rice seed development through regulation of starch metabolism gene expression	Down-regulation of OsSRT1 induced higher expression of Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1) and amylases genes in developing seeds, which resulted in a decrease of starch synthesis and an increase of starch degradation, leading to abnormal seed development
Ehd2|RID1	RSR1|qHD5	qHD5 encodes an AP2 factor that suppresses rice heading by down-regulating Ehd2 expression.	qHD5 encodes an AP2 factor that suppresses rice heading by down-regulating Ehd2 expression.
Ehd2|RID1	RSR1|qHD5	qHD5 encodes an AP2 factor that suppresses rice heading by down-regulating Ehd2 expression.	 qRT-PCR analysis revealed that qHD5 represses flowering by down-regulating Ehd2
OsLMP1|OsUBP2	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 Map-based cloning showed that the mutated gene in rsr1 encodes a Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2)
OsLMP1|OsUBP2	RSR1|qHD5	Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 2 (OsUBP2) Negatively Regulates Cell Death and Disease Resistance in Rice.	 The ubiquitinated proteomics data of rsr1 and WT provide some possible target protein candidates for OsUBP2
