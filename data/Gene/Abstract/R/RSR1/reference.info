927.pdf	Coexpression analysis identifies Rice Starch Regulator1, a rice AP2/EREBP family transcription factor, as a novel rice starch biosynthesis regulator	2010	Plant Physiol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Starch biosynthesis is important for plant development and is a critical factor in crop quality and nutrition. As a complex metabolic pathway, the regulation of starch biosynthesis is still poorly understood. We here present the identification of candidate regulators for starch biosynthesis by gene coexpression analysis in rice (Oryza sativa). Starch synthesis genes can be grouped into type I (in seeds; sink tissues) and type II (in vegetative tissues; source tissues), and 307 and 621 coexpressed genes are putatively involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice seeds and vegetative tissues, respectively. Among these genes, Rice Starch Regulator1 (RSR1), an APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein family transcription factor, was found to negatively regulate the expression of type I starch synthesis genes, and RSR1 deficiency results in the enhanced expression of starch synthesis genes in seeds. Seeds of the knockout mutant rsr1 consistently show the increased amylose content and altered fine structure of amylopectin and consequently form the round and loosely packed starch granules, resulting in decreased gelatinization temperature. In addition, rsr1 mutants have a larger seed size and increased seed mass and yield. In contrast, RSR1 overexpression suppresses the expression of starch synthesis genes, resulting in altered amylopectin structure and increased gelatinization temperature. Interestingly, a decreased proportion of A chains in rsr1 results in abnormal starch granules but reduced gelatinization temperature, whereas an increased proportion of A chains in RSR1-overexpressing plants leads to higher gelatinization temperatures, which is novel and different from previous reports, further indicating the complicated regulation of starch synthesis and determination of the physicochemical properties of starch. These results demonstrate the potential of coexpression analysis for studying rice starch biosynthesis and the regulation of a complex metabolic pathway and provide informative clues, including the characterization of RSR1, to facilitate the improvement of rice quality and nutrition.
NA	qHD5 encodes an AP2 factor that suppresses rice heading by down-regulating Ehd2 expression.	2022	Plant Sci	China National Center for Rice Improvement &amp; State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China; Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanghai 201403, China.	Heading date is crucial for rice reproduction and the geographical expansion of cultivation. We fine-mapped qHD5 and identified LOC_Os05g03040, a gene that encodes an AP2 transcription factor, as the candidate gene of qHD5 in our previous study. In this article, using two near-isogenic lines NIL(BG1) and NIL(XLJ), which were derived from the progeny of the cross between BigGrain1 (BG1) and Xiaolijing (XLJ), we verified that LOC_Os05g03040 represses heading date in rice through genetic complementation and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing experiments. Complementary results showed that qHD5 is a semi-dominant gene and that the qHD5(XLJ) and qHD5(BG1) alleles are both functional. The homozygous mutant line generated from knocking out qHD5(XLJ) in NIL(XLJ) headed earlier than NIL(XLJ) under both short-day and long-day conditions. In addition, the homozygous mutant line of qHD5(BG1) in NIL(BG1) also headed slightly earlier than NIL(BG1). All of these results show that qHD5 represses the heading date in rice. Transient expression showed that the qHD5 protein localizes to the nucleus. Transactivation activity assays showed that the C-terminus is the critical site that affects self-activation in qHD5(XLJ). qRT-PCR analysis revealed that qHD5 represses flowering by down-regulating Ehd2. qHD5 may have been selected during indica rice domestication.
