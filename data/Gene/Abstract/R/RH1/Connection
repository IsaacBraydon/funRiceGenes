RH1	RH2	A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation	 We identified three NRR homologues (RH1, RH2, and RH3)| RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation| NRR, RH1, RH2, and RH3 share sequence similarity in a region beyond the previously identified NPR1-interacting domain| RH2 carries a deviation (amino acids AV) in this region as compared to consensus sequences (amino acids ED) among NRR, RH1, and RH3
OsNPR1|NH1	RH1	A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation	 RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation| NRR, RH1, RH2, and RH3 share sequence similarity in a region beyond the previously identified NPR1-interacting domain
