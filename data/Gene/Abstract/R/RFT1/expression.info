RFT1	Overexpression of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) Induces Extremely Early Flowering in Rice. |  To further our study of RFT1 , we overexpressed the gene and examined the expression patterns of major regulatory genes during floral transition and inflorescence development |  This indicated that RFT1 promotes the expression of major regulatory genes that are important for inflorescence development |  RFT1 overexpression also induced SEPALLATA (SEP)-clade genes OsMADS1 , OsMADS5 , and OsMADS7 in the greening calli before floral transition occurred |  We found it interesting that expression of OsFD1 as well as OsFD2 and OsFD3 was strongly increased in the RFT1 -expressing calli and spikelets	Overexpression of RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1) Induces Extremely Early Flowering in Rice. |  RFT1 overexpression also induced SEPALLATA (SEP)-clade genes OsMADS1 , OsMADS5 , and OsMADS7 in the greening calli before floral transition occurred
OsGI-Hd1-Hd3a|RFT1	 RNA-seq analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMBD707 led to reduced photoperiod sensitivity in rice and to expression changes in flowering regulator genes in the Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway	 RNA-seq analysis revealed that overexpression of OsMBD707 led to reduced photoperiod sensitivity in rice and to expression changes in flowering regulator genes in the Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway
