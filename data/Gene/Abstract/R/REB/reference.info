J. Biol. Chem.-2001-Onodera-14139-52.pdf	A rice functional transcriptional activator, RISBZ1, responsible for endosperm-specific expression of storage protein genes through GCN4 motif	2001	J Biol Chem	Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The GCN4 motif, a cis-element that is highly conserved in the promoters of cereal seed storage protein genes, plays a central role in controlling endosperm-specific expression. This motif is the recognition site for a basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor that belongs to the group of maize Opaque-2 (O2)-like proteins. Five different basic leucine zipper cDNA clones, designated RISBZ1-5, have been isolated from a rice seed cDNA library. The predicted gene products can be divided into two groups based on their amino acid sequences. Although all the RISBZ proteins are able to interact with the GCN4 motif, only RISBZ1 is capable of activating (more than 100-fold expression) the expression of a reporter gene under a minimal promoter fused to a pentamer of the GCN4 motif. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain revealed that the proline-rich N-terminal domain (27 amino acids in length) is responsible for transactivation. The RISBZ1 protein is capable of forming homodimers as well as heterodimers with other RISBZ subunit proteins. RISBZ1 gene expression is restricted to the seed, where it precedes the expression of storage protein genes. When the RISBZ1 promoter was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene and the chimeric gene was introduced into rice, the beta-glucuronidase gene is specifically expressed in aleurone and subaleurone layer of the developing endosperm. These findings suggest that the specific expression of transcriptional activator RISBZ1 gene may determine the endosperm specificity of the storage protein genes.
Nakase-1997-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter	1997	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Applied Biological Sciences, School of Agricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Japan.	Many plant basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) proteins have been isolated several of which have been shown to play a role in seed-specific gene expression. We isolated a novel bZIP protein (REB) gene encoding 425 amino acid residues from rice endosperm, which is similar to Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) of maize. The gene product, termed REB, contains Pro- and Gly-rich regions at its N terminus, followed by the typical basic and leucine-repeat regions. Recombinant REB binds to the region from -754 to -562 in the alpha-globulin gene promoter, but not to promoters of other major storage genes such as glutelin, prolamin and albumin. The 5' region of the alpha-globulin gene possesses three binding sites for REB, which were determined as GCCACGT(A/C)AG, by using synthetic oligonucleotides. A Super-shift assay using anti-REB antibody suggested that REB is a major DNA-binding protein for the alpha-globulin gene promoter in rice endosperm.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
Yang-2001-Expression of the RE.pdf	Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Applied Phytologics, Incorporated, Sacramento, CA 95834, USA.	The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice. The cloned 6,227-bp-long Reb gene is composed of six exons and five introns and is flanked by a 1.2-kb 5' promoter and a 1.2-kb 3' terminator region. The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system. The effector constructs containing the native gene or fusion genes linking Reb to the rice actin (Act) or globulin (Glb) gene promoters and the reporter gene construct Glb-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) were used in this study. When these effector constructs were cotransferred with the reporter uidA gene encoding GUS under the control of the Glb promoter into immature rice endosperm cells, the Glb promoter was activated. The transient GUS expression was 2.0 to 2.5-fold higher with the effector construct than without. When the upstream activation sequence containing the GCCACGT(A/C)AG motifs of the Glb promoter was deleted, the activation by REB was abolished. On the other hand, a gain-of-function experiment showed that inserting the upstream activation sequence into the glutelin-1 (Gt1) promoter made it responsive to activation by REB. When cotransformed with Reb gene, mature transgenic rice grains containing the human lysozyme gene driven by the Glb promoter produced 3.7-fold more lysozyme. Accumulation of recombinant lysozyme in mature seed ranged from 30.57 to 279.61 microg.mg(-1) total soluble protein in individual transformants from 30 independent transformation events. Thus, our results show that REB is not only a transcriptional activator, it can also be used to increase the expression of recombinant protein in transgenic rice grains.
