REB	transcription factor	Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter	The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice
REB	endosperm	Expression of the REB transcriptional activator in rice grains improves the yield of recombinant proteins whose genes are controlled by a Reb-responsive promoter	The gene encoding the rice transcription factor, REB (rice endosperm bZIP) was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome library of rice| The function of the Reb gene was explored by a transient assay by using a rice immature endosperm system
REB	endosperm	Characterization of a novel rice bZIP protein which binds to the alpha-globulin promoter	 We isolated a novel bZIP protein (REB) gene encoding 425 amino acid residues from rice endosperm, which is similar to Opaque-2 heterodimerizing protein (OHP) of maize| A Super-shift assay using anti-REB antibody suggested that REB is a major DNA-binding protein for the alpha-globulin gene promoter in rice endosperm
