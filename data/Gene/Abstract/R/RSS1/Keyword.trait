RSS1	starch biosynthesis	Cloning and expression of rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose synthase 1 (RSs1) in developing seed endosperm	 No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of RSs1 transcript levels were observed

RSS1	phytohormone	RSS1 regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice	 These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin
