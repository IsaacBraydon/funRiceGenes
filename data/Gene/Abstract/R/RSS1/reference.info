RSs1 was expressed predominantly in the endosperm of milky stage rice seeds with maximum expression at 3~5 days after pollination which were 8~10-fold over leaf levels. The peak in RSs1 transcript levels preceded the peak of enzyme activity which occured 9~11 days after pollination. RSs1 transcript and activity levels were analyzed in two starch deficient mutants of rice to determine if the lesion in these mutants resides at the locus for RSs1. No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of RSs1 transcript levels were observed.

Post embryonic growth of plants depends on cell division activity in the shoot and root meristems, in conjunction with subsequent cell differentiation. Under environmental stress conditions, where plant growth is moderately impaired, the meristematic activity is maintained by mechanisms as yet unknown. We previously showed that the rice protein RSS1, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions. RSS1 interacts with a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), but other molecular characteristics are largely unknown. Here we show that RSS1 interacts with all the PP1 expressed in the shoot apex of rice. This interaction requires one of the conserved regions of RSS1, which is important for RSS1 function. Interestingly, the recombinant RSS1 protein is highly resistant to heat with respect to its anti-coagulability and binding activity to PP1. The features of RSS1 are reminiscent of those of inhibitor-2 of animals, although it is likely that the mode of function of RSS1 is different from that of inhibitor-2. Noticeably, RSS1 binds to PP1 under extremely high ionic strength conditions in vitro. Therefore, RSS1 possibly functions by forming a stable complex with PP1.
ncomms1279.pdf	RSS1 regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice	2011	Nat Commun	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Plant growth and development are sustained by continuous cell division in the meristems, which is perturbed by various environmental stresses. For the maintenance of meristematic functions, it is essential that cell division be coordinated with cell differentiation. However, it is unknown how the proliferative activities of the meristems and the coordination between cell division and differentiation are maintained under stressful conditions. Here we show that a rice protein, RSS1, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions. These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin. RSS1 is conserved widely in plant lineages, except eudicots, suggesting that RSS1-dependent mechanisms might have been adopted in specific lineages during the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.
NA	Maintenance of meristem activity under stress: is there an interplay of RSS1-like proteins with the RBR pathway ?	2015	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	Laboratory of Plant Protection and Improvement, Center of Biotechnology of Sfax, BP1177, 3018, Sfax.	Plants have acquired rapid responses to constantly changing environment. These adaptive and protective responses are the result of a complex signaling network regulating different aspects ranging from ion homeostasis to cell cycle control. It is well established that stress inhibits cell division which negatively impacts plant growth and development and hence results in biomass decrease and yield loss. Therefore understanding the link between stress perception and cell cycle control would allow the development of new crops with increased productivity when subjected to stress. However, studies on cell cycle control under stress have been limited to well-known regulators of cell cycle like cyclins and stress-related phytohormone integrators. The recent discovery of RSS1, a novel intrinsically unstructured protein of rice opened up new insights on how stress perception can be connected with cell cycle control in meristematic zones. Whereas RSS1 is well conserved among other plant lineages, eudicots present proteins sharing only little sequence homology with RSS1. Here, we discuss how RSS1-like proteins might be functional also in dicots and possibly act through the retinoblastoma related pathway to regulate both S-phase transition and cell fate in meristems.

NA	The wheat TdRL1 is the functional homolog of the rice RSS1 and promotes plant salt stress tolerance.	2018	Plant Cell Rep	Laboratoire de Biotechnologie et d'Am¨¦lioration des Plantes, Centre de Biotechnologie de Sfax, BP 1177, 3018, Sfax, Tunisia.	Rice rss1 complementation assays show that wheat TdRL1 and RSS1 are true functional homologs. TdRL1 over-expression in Arabidopsis conferred salt stress tolerance and alleviated ROS accumulation. Plants have developed highly flexible adaptive responses to their ever-changing environment, which are often mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP). RICE SALT SENSITIVE 1 and Triticum durum RSS1-Like 1 protein (TdRL1) are both IDPs involved in abiotic stress responses, and possess conserved D and DEN-Boxes known to be required for post-translational degradation by the APC/Ccdc20 cyclosome. To further understand their function, we performed a computational analysis to compare RSS1 and TdRL1 co-expression networks revealing common gene ontologies, among which those related to cell cycle progression and regulation of microtubule (MT) networks were over-represented. When over-expressed in Arabidopsis, TdRL1::GFP was present in dividing cells and more visible in cortical and endodermal cells of the Root Apical Meristem (RAM). Incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 stabilized TdRL1::GFP expression in RAM cells showing a post-translational regulation. Moreover, immuno-cytochemical analyses of transgenic roots showed that TdRL1 was present in the cytoplasm and within the microtubular spindle of mitotic cells, while, in interphasic cells, it was rather restricted to the cytoplasm with a spotty pattern at the nuclear periphery. Interestingly in cells subjected to stress, TdRL1 was partly relocated into the nucleus. Moreover, TdRL1 transgenic lines showed increased germination rates under salt stress conditions as compared to wild type. This enhanced salt stress tolerance was associated to an alleviation of oxidative damage. Finally, when expressed in the rice rss1 mutant, TdRL1 suppressed its dwarf phenotype upon salt stress, confirming that both proteins are true functional homologs required for salt stress tolerance in cereals.
