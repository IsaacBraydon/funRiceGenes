RSs1 was expressed predominantly in the endosperm of milky stage rice seeds with maximum expression at 3~5 days after pollination which were 8~10-fold over leaf levels. The peak in RSs1 transcript levels preceded the peak of enzyme activity which occured 9~11 days after pollination. RSs1 transcript and activity levels were analyzed in two starch deficient mutants of rice to determine if the lesion in these mutants resides at the locus for RSs1. No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of RSs1 transcript levels were observed.

Post embryonic growth of plants depends on cell division activity in the shoot and root meristems, in conjunction with subsequent cell differentiation. Under environmental stress conditions, where plant growth is moderately impaired, the meristematic activity is maintained by mechanisms as yet unknown. We previously showed that the rice protein RSS1, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions. RSS1 interacts with a catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), but other molecular characteristics are largely unknown. Here we show that RSS1 interacts with all the PP1 expressed in the shoot apex of rice. This interaction requires one of the conserved regions of RSS1, which is important for RSS1 function. Interestingly, the recombinant RSS1 protein is highly resistant to heat with respect to its anti-coagulability and binding activity to PP1. The features of RSS1 are reminiscent of those of inhibitor-2 of animals, although it is likely that the mode of function of RSS1 is different from that of inhibitor-2. Noticeably, RSS1 binds to PP1 under extremely high ionic strength conditions in vitro. Therefore, RSS1 possibly functions by forming a stable complex with PP1.
ncomms1279.pdf	RSS1 regulates the cell cycle and maintains meristematic activity under stress conditions in rice	2011	Nat Commun	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Plant growth and development are sustained by continuous cell division in the meristems, which is perturbed by various environmental stresses. For the maintenance of meristematic functions, it is essential that cell division be coordinated with cell differentiation. However, it is unknown how the proliferative activities of the meristems and the coordination between cell division and differentiation are maintained under stressful conditions. Here we show that a rice protein, RSS1, whose stability is controlled by cell cycle phases, contributes to the vigour of meristematic cells and viability under salinity conditions. These effects of RSS1 are exerted by regulating the G1-S transition, possibly through an interaction of RSS1 with protein phosphatase 1, and are mediated by the phytohormone, cytokinin. RSS1 is conserved widely in plant lineages, except eudicots, suggesting that RSS1-dependent mechanisms might have been adopted in specific lineages during the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms.
