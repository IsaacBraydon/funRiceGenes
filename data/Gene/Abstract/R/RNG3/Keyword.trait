RNG3	blight	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits
RNG3	bacterial blight	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits
RNG3	blast	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 Knocking out either RNG1 or RNG3 in rice enhanced the rice blast and bacterial blight resistance, without impacting critical agronomic traits
RNG3	breeding	Identification of two novel rice S genes through combination of association and transcription analyses with gene-editing technology.	 The obvious selective sweep flanking RNG3 suggested it has been artificially selected in modern rice breeding
