RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 (rps14), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	The nuclear rps14 gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) protein from human and a malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum)
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the rps14-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the rps14 gene
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	The migration of the mitochondrial rps14 sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins

RPS14|OsSDH2-1	root	LPS1, Encoding Iron-Sulfur Subunit SDH2-1 of Succinate Dehydrogenase, Affects Leaf Senescence and Grain Yield in Rice	 OsSDH2-1 gene was expressed in all organs tested, with higher expression in leaves, root tips, ovary and anthers
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	mitochondria	LPS1, Encoding Iron-Sulfur Subunit SDH2-1 of Succinate Dehydrogenase, Affects Leaf Senescence and Grain Yield in Rice	 OsSDH2-1 protein was targeted to mitochondria
RPS14|OsSDH2-1	yield	LPS1, Encoding Iron-Sulfur Subunit SDH2-1 of Succinate Dehydrogenase, Affects Leaf Senescence and Grain Yield in Rice	 Taken together, OsSDH2-1 plays a crucial role in leaf senescence and yield formation in rice
