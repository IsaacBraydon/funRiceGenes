PNAS-1999-Kubo-9207-11.pdf	A single nuclear transcript encoding mitochondrial RPS14 and SDHB of rice is processed by alternative splicing: Common use of the same mitochondrial targeting signal for different proteins	1999	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Faculty of Horticulture, Chiba University, Matsudo 648, Matsudo, Chiba 271-0092, Japan.	The rice mitochondrial genome has a sequence homologous to the gene for ribosomal protein S14 (rps14), but the coding sequence is interrupted by internal stop codons. A functional rps14 gene was isolated from the rice nuclear genome, suggesting a gene-transfer event from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. The nuclear rps14 gene encodes a long N-terminal extension showing significant similarity to a part of mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) protein from human and a malarial parasite (Plasmodium falciparum). Isolation of a functional rice sdhB cDNA and subsequent sequence comparison to the nuclear rps14 indicate that the 5' portions of the two cDNAs are identical. The sdhB genomic sequence shows that the SDHB-coding region is divided into two exons. Surprisingly, the RPS14-coding region is located between the two exons. DNA gel blot analysis indicates that both sdhB and rps14 are present at a single locus in the rice nucleus. These findings strongly suggest that the two gene transcripts result from a single mRNA precursor by alternative splicing. Protein blot analysis shows that the size of the mature RPS14 is 16.5 kDa, suggesting removal of the N-terminal 22.6-kDa peptide region. Considering that the rice mitochondrial genome lacks the sdhB gene but contains the rps14-related sequence, transfer of the sdhB gene seems to have occurred before the transfer of the rps14 gene. The migration of the mitochondrial rps14 sequence into the already existing sdhB gene could bestow the capacity for nuclear expression and mitochondrial targeting.
NA	LPS1, Encoding Iron-Sulfur Subunit SDH2-1 of Succinate Dehydrogenase, Affects Leaf Senescence and Grain Yield in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	The iron-sulfur subunit (SDH2) of succinate dehydrogenase plays a key role in electron transport in plant mitochondria. However, it is yet unknown whether SDH2 genes are involved in leaf senescence and yield formation. In this study, we isolated a late premature senescence mutant, lps1, in rice (Oryza sativa). The mutant leaves exhibited brown spots at late tillering stage and wilted at the late grain-filling stage and mature stage. In its premature senescence leaves, photosynthetic pigment contents and net photosynthetic rate were reduced; chloroplasts and mitochondria were degraded. Meanwhile, lps1 displayed small panicles, low seed-setting rate and dramatically reduced grain yield. Gene cloning and complementation analysis suggested that the causal gene for the mutant phenotype was OsSDH2-1 (LOC_Os08g02640), in which single nucleotide mutation resulted in an amino acid substitution in the encoded protein. OsSDH2-1 gene was expressed in all organs tested, with higher expression in leaves, root tips, ovary and anthers. OsSDH2-1 protein was targeted to mitochondria. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly H2O2, was excessively accumulated in leaves and young panicles of lps1, which could cause premature leaf senescence and affect panicle development and pollen function. Taken together, OsSDH2-1 plays a crucial role in leaf senescence and yield formation in rice.
