Yang-2001-Kiddo, a new transpo.pdf	Kiddo, a new transposable element family closely associated with rice genes	2001	Mol Genet Genomics	Institute of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX 77843-3155, USA.	The promoter region of the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) gene was found to be polymorphic between japonica (T309) and indica (IR24) lines as the result of a 270-bp deletion in T309. A TTATA footprint in the T309 rubq2 promoter suggested that an excision event had occurred, and inspection of the 270-bp region present in IR24 revealed that it had all the characteristics of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE). Database searches showed that this element is a member of a new MITE family, which we have named Kiddo. Thirty-five complete Kiddo sequences were identified in existing rice genomic sequence databases. They could be arranged into four groups, within-group sequence identity was over 90%, with 65-75% identity between groups. The high sequence similarity within a group indicates that some Kiddo members were recently mobile and may still be active. An additional 24 decayed Kiddo sequences were detected. Interestingly, approximately 80% of 18 Kiddo members from annotated accessions lie within 530 bp of a coding sequence. That approximately 40% of Kiddo members present in genic regions reside in introns suggests that Kiddo transposition entails the use of both DNA and RNA intermediates, and may provide some insight into the origins of individual groups. DNA blot analysis showed that Kiddo is a rice-specific element, although one sequence with limited (72%) similarity to Kiddo group A was detected as a wheat EST. Kiddo family members may represent new molecular and phylogenetic markers, as well as representing valuable materials for studying the molecular mechanisms of MITE transposition.

Miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are thought to be a driving force for genome evolution. Although numerous MITEs are found associated with genes, little is known about their function in gene regulation. Whereas the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) promoter in rice (Oryza sativa) line IR24 contains two nested MITEs (Kiddo and MDM1), that in line T309 has lost Kiddo, providing an opportunity to understand the role of MITEs in promoter function. No difference in endogenous rubq2 transcript levels between T309 and IR24 was evident using RT-PCR. However, promoter analysis using both transient and stably transformed calli revealed that Kiddo contributed some 20% of the total expression. Bisulfite genomic sequencing of the rubq2 promoters revealed specific DNA methylation at both symmetric and asymmetric cytosine residues on the MITE sequences, possibly induced by low levels of homologous transcripts. When methylation of the MITEs was blocked by 5-azacytidine treatment, a threefold increase in the endogenous rubq2 transcript level was detected in IR24 compared with that in T309. Together with the observed MITE methylation pattern, the detection of low levels of transcripts, but not small RNAs, corresponding to Kiddo and MDM1 suggested that RNA-dependent DNA methylation is induced by MITE transcripts. We conclude that, although Kiddo enhances transcription from the rubq2 promoter, this effect is mitigated by sequence-specific epigenetic modification.
NA	Endoplasmic Reticulum-Localized PURINE PERMEASE1 Regulates Plant Height and Grain Weight by Modulating Cytokinin Distribution in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Southern Regional Collaborative Innovation Center for Grain and Oil Crops in China, College of Agriculture, Hunan Agricultural University, Changsha, China.	Cytokinins (CKs) are a class of phytohormones playing essential roles in various biological processes. However, the mechanisms underlying CK transport as well as its function in plant growth and development are far from being fully elucidated. Here, we characterize the function of PURINE PERMEASE1 (OsPUP1) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). OsPUP1 was predominantly expressed in the root, particularly in vascular cells, and CK treatment can induce its expression. Subcellular localization analysis showed that OsPUP1 was predominantly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Overexpression of OsPUP1 resulted in growth defect of various aerial tissues, including decreased leaf length, plant height, grain weight, panicle length, and grain number. Hormone profiling revealed that the CK content was decreased in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling, but increased in the root, compared with the wild type. The CK content in the panicle was also decreased. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis using several CK type-A response regulators (OsRRs) as the marker genes suggested that the CK response in the shoot of OsPUP1-overexpressing seedling is decreased compared to the wild type when CKs are applied to the root. Genetic analysis revealed that BG3/OsPUP4, a putative plasma membrane-localized CK transporter, overcomes the function of OsPUP1. We hypothesize that OsPUP1 might be involved in importing CKs into ER to unload CKs from the vascular tissues by cell-to-cell transport.
