DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	RGG1	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1
GS3	RGG1	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1
RGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries
RGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	 Marker-free transgenic IR64 rice lines that simultaneously overexpress both RGB1 and RGG1 genes under CaMV35S promoter were raised
RGB1	RGG1	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	 Overall, the present study provides evidence that concurrent overexpression of G-protein subunits (RGG1 and RGB1) impart multiple (both biotic and abiotic) stress tolerance in rice which could be due to the enhanced expression of stress-marker genes and better management of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging/photosynthetic machinery
