RGG1	 The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200mM NaCl |  The RGG1-induced signalling events that conferred tolerance to salinity was mediated by increased gene expression of the enzymes that scavenged reactive oxygen species	 The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl
RGG1	Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries |  Overall, the present study provides evidence that concurrent overexpression of G-protein subunits (RGG1 and RGB1) impart multiple (both biotic and abiotic) stress tolerance in rice which could be due to the enhanced expression of stress-marker genes and better management of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging/photosynthetic machinery	Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries |  Overall, the present study provides evidence that concurrent overexpression of G-protein subunits (RGG1 and RGB1) impart multiple (both biotic and abiotic) stress tolerance in rice which could be due to the enhanced expression of stress-marker genes and better management of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging/photosynthetic machinery
RGG1	 Overexpression of RGG1 in Nipponbare (NIP) and Wuyunjing 30 (WYJ30) significantly decreased plant height, panicle length and grain length by regulating cell division |  However, rgg1 mutants generated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system exhibited no obvious phenotypic differences, which may be due to the extremely low expression level of this gene in vivo |  The transcriptomes of young panicles of NIP, the NIP-rgg1-2 mutant and the NIP-OE2 overexpression line were sequenced, and the results showed that many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway |  Additionally, increased expression of RGG1 decreased sensitivity to low concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA)	 Overexpression of RGG1 in Nipponbare (NIP) and Wuyunjing 30 (WYJ30) significantly decreased plant height, panicle length and grain length by regulating cell division |  The transcriptomes of young panicles of NIP, the NIP-rgg1-2 mutant and the NIP-OE2 overexpression line were sequenced, and the results showed that many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were associated with the cytokinin biosynthetic pathway
