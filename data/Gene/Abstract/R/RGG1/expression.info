RGG1	 The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200mM NaCl |  The RGG1-induced signalling events that conferred tolerance to salinity was mediated by increased gene expression of the enzymes that scavenged reactive oxygen species	 The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl
