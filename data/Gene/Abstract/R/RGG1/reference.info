NA	Function of heterotrimeric G-protein gamma subunit RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in rice by elevating detoxification of ROS.	2016	Planta	International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	The present study provides evidence of a unique function of RGG1 in providing salinity stress tolerance in transgenic rice without affecting yield. It also provides a good example for signal transduction from the external environment to inside for enhanced agricultural production that withstands the extreme climatic conditions and ensures food security. The role of heterotrimeric G-proteins functioning as signalling molecules has not been studied as extensively in plants as in animals. Recently, their importance in plant stress signalling has been emerging. In this study, the function of rice G-protein gamma subunit (RGG1) in the promotion of salinity tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. IR64) was investigated. The overexpression of RGG1 driven by the CaMV35S promoter in transgenic rice conferred high salinity tolerance even in the presence of 200<U+00A0>mM NaCl. Transcript levels of antioxidative genes, i.e., CAT, APX, and GR, and their enzyme activities increased in salinity-stressed transgenic rice plants suggesting a better antioxidant system to cope the oxidative-damages caused by salinity stress. The RGG1-induced signalling events that conferred tolerance to salinity was mediated by increased gene expression of the enzymes that scavenged reactive oxygen species. In salinity-stressed RGG1 transgenic lines, the transcript levels of RGG2, RGB, RGA, DEP1, and GS3 also increased in addition to RGG1. These observations suggest that most likely the stoichiometry of the G-protein complex was not disturbed under stress. Agronomic parameters, endogenous sugar content (glucose and fructose) and hormones (GA3, zeatin and IAA) were also higher in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants. A BiFC assay confirmed the interaction of RGG1 with different stress-responsive proteins which play active roles in signalling and prevention of aggregation of proteins under stress-induced perturbation. The present study will help in understanding the G-protein-mediated stress tolerance in plants.
NA	Concurrent overexpression of rice G-protein β and γ subunits provide enhanced tolerance to sheath blight disease and abiotic stress in rice.	2019	Planta	Plant Microbe Interactions Laboratory, National Institute of Plant Genome Research, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	Our study demonstrates that simultaneous overexpression of RGB1 and RGG1 genes provides multiple stress tolerance in rice by inducing stress responsive genes and better management of ROS scavenging/photosynthetic machineries. The heterotrimeric G-proteins act as signalling molecules and modulate various cellular responses including stress tolerance in eukaryotes. The gamma (γ) subunit of rice G-protein (RGG1) was earlier reported to promote salinity stress tolerance in rice. In the present study, we report that a rice gene-encoding beta (β) subunit of G-protein (RGB1) gets upregulated during both biotic (upon a necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Rhizoctonia solani infection) and drought stresses. Marker-free transgenic IR64 rice lines that simultaneously overexpress both RGB1 and RGG1 genes under CaMV35S promoter were raised. The overexpressing (OE) lines showed enhanced tolerance to R. solani infection and salinity/drought stresses. Several defense marker genes including OsMPK3 were significantly upregulated in the R. solani-infected OE lines. We also found the antioxidant machineries to be upregulated during salinity as well as drought stress in the OE lines. Overall, the present study provides evidence that concurrent overexpression of G-protein subunits (RGG1 and RGB1) impart multiple (both biotic and abiotic) stress tolerance in rice which could be due to the enhanced expression of stress-marker genes and better management of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging/photosynthetic machinery. The current study suggests an improved approach for simultaneous improvement of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in rice which remains a major challenge for its sustainable cultivation.
