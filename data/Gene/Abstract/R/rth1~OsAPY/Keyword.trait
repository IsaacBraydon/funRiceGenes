rth1|OsAPY	growth	Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice	 Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype| OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
rth1|OsAPY	root	Molecular cloning of a root hairless gene rth1 in rice	 Transgenic plants with introduced OsAPY allele restored normal root hairs and plant growth, showing a complementation of rth1 phenotype| We concluded that the root hairless phenotype of rth1 is caused by a mutation of OsAPY| OsAPY appears to be an important gene for root hair elongation and plant growth in rice
