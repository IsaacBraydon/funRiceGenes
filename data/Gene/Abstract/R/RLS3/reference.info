NA	RLS3, a protein with AAA+ domain localized in chloroplast, sustains leaf longevity in rice.	2016	J Integr Plant Biol	MOE Key Laboratory of Crop Heterosis and Utilization, State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, National Center for Evaluation of Agricultural Wild Plants (Rice), Department of Plant Genetics and Breeding, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Leaf senescence plays an important role in crop developmental processes that dramatically affect crop yields and grain quality. The genetic regulation of leaf senescence is complex, involving many metabolic and signaling pathways. Here, we identified a rapid leaf senescence 3 (rls3) mutant that displayed accelerated leaf senescence, shorter plant height and panicle length, and lower seed set rate than the wild type. Map-based cloning revealed that RLS3 encodes a protein with AAA+ domain, localizing it to chloroplasts. Sequence analysis found that the rls3 gene had a single-nucleotide substitution (Gâ†’A) at the splice site of the 10(th) intron/11(th) exon, resulting in the cleavage of 11(th) exon and premature termination of RLS3 protein translation. Using transmission electron microscope, the chloroplasts of the rls3 mutant were observed to degrade much faster than those of the wild type. The investigation of the leaf senescence process under dark incubation conditions further revealed that the rls3 mutant displayed rapid leaf senescence. Thus, the RLS3 gene played key roles in sustaining the normal growth of rice, while loss of function in RLS3 leads to rapid leaf senescence. The Identification of RLS3 will be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms involved in leaf senescence in rice.
NA	Disruption of a Upf1-like helicase-encoding gene OsPLS2 triggers light-dependent premature leaf senescence in rice.	2019	Plant Mol Biol	Department of Agronomy, Zhejiang University, Zijingang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China.	The OsPLS2 locus was isolated and cloned by map-based cloning that encodes a Upf1-like helicase. Disruption of OsPLS2 accelerated light-dependent leaf senescence in the rice mutant of ospls2. Leaf senescence is a very complex physiological process controlled by both genetic and environmental factors, however its underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we report a novel Oryza sativa premature leaf senescence mutant (ospls2). Through map-based cloning, a G-to-A substitution was determined at the 1st nucleotide of the 13th intron in the OsPLS2 gene that encodes a Upf1-like helicase. This mutation prompts aberrant splicing of OsPLS2 messenger and consequent disruption of its full-length protein translation, suggesting a negative role of OsPLS2 in regulating leaf senescence. Wild-type rice accordingly displayed a progressive drop of OsPSL2 protein levels with age-dependent leaf senescence. Shading and light filtration studies showed that the ospls2 phenotype, which was characteristic of photo-oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, was an effect of irritation by light. When continuously exposed to far-red light, exogenous H2O2 and/or abscisic acid (ABA), the ospls2 mutant sustained hypersensitive leaf senescence. In consistence, light and ROS signal pathways in ospls2 were activated by down-regulation of phytochrome genes, and up-regulation of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) and WRKY genes, all promoting leaf senescence. Together, these data indicated that OsPLS2 played an essential role in leaf senescence and its disruption triggered light-dependent leaf senescence in rice.
