RLS3|OsPLS2	leaf	Disruption of a Upf1-like helicase-encoding gene OsPLS2 triggers light-dependent premature leaf senescence in rice.	 This mutation prompts aberrant splicing of OsPLS2 messenger and consequent disruption of its full-length protein translation, suggesting a negative role of OsPLS2 in regulating leaf senescence
RLS3|OsPLS2	leaf	Disruption of a Upf1-like helicase-encoding gene OsPLS2 triggers light-dependent premature leaf senescence in rice.	 When continuously exposed to far-red light, exogenous H2O2 and/or abscisic acid (ABA), the ospls2 mutant sustained hypersensitive leaf senescence
