RBG1	 Ectopic expression of RBG1 leads to significant increases in the size not only of grains but also other major organs such as roots, shoots and panicles |  Ectopic expression of RBG1 promotes cell division, and RBG1 co-localizes with microtubules known to be involved in cell division, which may account for the increase in organ size |  Ectopic expression of RBG1 also increases auxin accumulation and sensitivity, which facilitates root development, particularly crown roots |  Moreover, overexpression of RBG1 upregulated a large number of heat shock proteins, leading to enhanced tolerance to heat, osmotic and salt stresses, as well as rapid recovery from water-deficit stress |  Ectopic expression of RBG1 regulated by a specific constitutive promoter, GOS2, enhanced harvest index and grain yield in rice	 Moreover, overexpression of RBG1 upregulated a large number of heat shock proteins, leading to enhanced tolerance to heat, osmotic and salt stresses, as well as rapid recovery from water-deficit stress
