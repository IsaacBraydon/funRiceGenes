Plant Cell Physiol-2007-Tokunaga-700-14.pdf	Induction of a novel XIP-type xylanase inhibitor by external ascorbic acid treatment and differential expression of XIP-family genes in rice	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Biosphere Sciences, Hiroshima University, Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima, 739-8528 Japan.	Rice microarray analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of L-ascorbic acid (AsA). The gene designated as AK073843 which is homologous to class capital SHA, Cyrillic chitinase was found to exhibit the highest induction among these genes. However, its crucial residues within the chitinase active site are substituted with other residues, suggesting that the protein has no chitinase activity. The recombinant protein which is encoded by the AK073843 gene produced in Escherichia coli has xylanase inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice XIP-type xylanase inhibitor protein (OsXIP). The expression of OsXIP was enhanced not only by exogenous AsA treatment but also by various stresses such as citrate and sodium chloride treatments, and wounding; however, it was not influenced by increasing endogenous AsA content. External AsA treatment caused a significant increase in electrolyte leakage from rice root. These results suggested that OsXIP was induced by stress which is caused by external AsA treatment. Rice XIP-family genes, OsXIP, riceXIP and RIXI, showed differential organ-specific expression. Also, these genes were differentially induced by stress and stress-related phytohormones. The transcripts of OsXIP and riceXIP were undetectable under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment in the root. RIXI was constitutively expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related phytohormones. Thus, XIP-type xylanase inhibitors were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in rice.
NA	Recombinant rice xylanase-inhibiting protein inhibits GH11 endo-xylanases through competitive inhibition.	2018	Protein Expr Purif	National &amp; Local United Engineering Lab of Quality Controlling Technology and Instrumentation for Marine Food, College of Life Science, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China.	The ricexip gene, which encodes the rice xylanase-inhibiting protein (riceXIP), was recombinantly expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 under the control of AOX1 promoter. Recombinant riceXIP (rePriceXIP) was secreted into the supernatant and purified to homogeneity with the use of Ni-affinity resin. The molecular mass of rePriceXIP was approximately 44.0<U+202F>kDa. RePriceXIP significantly inhibited the activity of GH11 xylanases in a concentration-dependent manner. The optimal inhibitory activity of rePriceXIP on GH11 xylanases (TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526) occurred at 40<U+202F>°„C for 30<U+202F>min. The IC50 values of rePriceXIP inhibiting TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 (0.5 U) were 45, 40, and 40<U+202F>nM, respectively. The Ki of rePriceXIP on TfxA_CD214 xylanase was 12.2<U+202F>nM. Increasing the concentration of rePriceXIP did not change Vmax, but increased Km, thereby suggesting that the inhibition was competitive. Analysis of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the Kq values for TfxA_CD214, reBaxA454, and TfxA_CD526 exceeded 2.0<U+202F>°¡<U+202F>1010<U+202F>L<U+202F>mol-1<U+2022>s-1, implying that static quenching occurred. Circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that rePriceXIP bound to xylanase, thereby changing the secondary structure and reducing the catalytic activity of xylanase. Lower levels of hydrolytes are released from beechwood xylan by xylanases in the presence of rePriceXIP.
