Sugimori-2002-Cloning and characte.pdf	Cloning and characterization of a jasmonic acid-responsive gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase in suspension-cultured rice cells	2003	Planta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	In suspension-cultured rice ( Oryza sativaL.) cells, jasmonic acid (JA) functions as a signal transducer in elicitor N-acetylchitoheptaose-induced phytoalexin production. Differential screening of a cDNA library constructed using poly(A)(+) RNA from suspension-cultured rice cells treated with JA (10(-4) M) for 2 h yielded a cDNA for a gene that responded to exogenous JA by an increase in mRNA level. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the cDNA encodes an homologue of the yeast Old Yellow Enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence was very similar to the sequences of 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductases (OPR) 1 and 2 from Arabidopsis thaliana(AtOPR1 and AtOPR2) and OPR1 from tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum) (LeOPR1). The cDNA-encoded protein purified from recombinant Escherichia coli cells as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein exhibited OPR activity similar to that of AtOPR1, AtOPR2, and LeOPR1, which catalyze reduction of (-)- cis-12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) preferentially over (+)- cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Thus the rice enzyme was termed OsOPR1. The physiological roles of OsOPR1 are discussed. This is the first report of the cloning of an OPR gene from a monocot plant.
