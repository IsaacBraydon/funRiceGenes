NA	Epigenetic Mutation of RAV6 Affects Leaf Angle and Seed Size in Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Institute of Genetics and Development Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN] xwsong@genetics.ac.cn.	Heritable epigenetic variants of genes, termed epialleles, can broaden genetic and phenotypic diversity in eukaryotes. Epialleles may also provide a new source of beneficial traits for crop breeding, but very few epialleles related to agricultural traits have been identified in crops. Here, we identified Epi-rav6, a gain-of-function epiallele of rice RELATED TO ABI3 AND VP1 6 (RAV6), which encodes a B3 DNA binding domain-containing protein. The Epi-rav6 plants show larger lamina inclination and smaller grain size; these agronomicially important phenotypes are inherited in a semi-dominant manner. We did not find nucleotide sequence variation of RAV6. Instead, we found hypomethylation in the promoter region of RAV6, which caused ectopic expression of RAV6 in Epi-rav6 plants. Bisulfite analysis revealed that cytosine methylation of 4 CG and 2 CNG loci within a continuous 96-bp region plays essential roles in regulating RAV6 expression; this region contains a conserved MITE transposon insertion in cultivated rice genomes. Overexpression of RAV6 in wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype. The brassinosteroid (BR) receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and BR biosynthetic genes EBISU DWARF (D2), DWARF11 (D11), and BR-DEFICIENT DWARF1 (BRD1) were ectopically expressed in Epi-rav6 plants. Also, treatment with a BR biosynthesis inhibitor restored the leaf angle defects of Epi-rav6 plants. This indicates that RAV6 affects rice leaf angle by modulating BR homeostasis and demonstrates an essential regulatory role of epigenetic modification on a key gene controlling important agricultural traits. Thus, our work identifies a novel rice epiallele, which may represent a common phenomenon in complex crop genomes.
