RAV6	 Instead, we found hypomethylation in the promoter region of RAV6, which caused ectopic expression of RAV6 in Epi-rav6 plants |  Bisulfite analysis revealed that cytosine methylation of 4 CG and 2 CNG loci within a continuous 96-bp region plays essential roles in regulating RAV6 expression; this region contains a conserved MITE transposon insertion in cultivated rice genomes |  Overexpression of RAV6 in wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype	 Overexpression of RAV6 in wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype
