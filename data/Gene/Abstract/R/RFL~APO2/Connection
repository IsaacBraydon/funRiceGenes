APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	RFL|APO2	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	 Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development|ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	RFL|APO2	Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture	 In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering
DDF1	RFL|APO2	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 In addition, DDF1 also negatively regulates the Arabidopsis LFY ortholog APO2, implying a functional connection between DDF1 and APO2
