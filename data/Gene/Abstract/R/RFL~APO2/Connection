APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development
APO1|OsAPO1|SCM2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1	ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1
OsMADS50|OsSOC1|DTH3	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Distinct regulatory role for RFL, the rice LFY homolog, in determining flowering time and plant architecture	In these transgenics, the expression levels of known flowering time genes reveal RFL as a regulator of OsSOC1 (OsMADS50), an activator of flowering
DDF1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Dwarf and deformed flower 1, encoding an F-box protein, is critical for vegetative and floral development in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	In addition, DDF1 also negatively regulates the Arabidopsis LFY ortholog APO2, implying a functional connection between DDF1 and APO2
D3	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	The relationship between RFL, strigolactone signalling, and bud outgrowth was studied by transcript analyses and by the tillering phenotype of transgenic plants knocked down for both RFL and D3
LAX1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	We show that RFL promotes AM specification through its effects on LAX1 and CUC genes, as their expression was modulated on RFL knockdown, on induction of RFL:GR fusion protein, and by a repressive RFL-EAR fusion protein
LAX1	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	Together, we have found that RFL regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	Further, we report reduced expression of auxin transporter genes OsPIN1 and OsPIN3 in the culm of RFL knockdown transgenic plants
OsPIN1|REH1|PIN1b|OsPIN1b	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.	These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	Regulatory role of FZP in the determination of panicle branching and spikelet formation in rice.	FRIZZLE PANICLE (FZP) and RFL/ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2 (APO2) play important roles in regulating the ABCDE floral organ identity genes
LARGE2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Biochemical analyses show that LARGE2 physically associates with ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) and APO2, two positive regulators of panicle size and grain number, and modulates their stabilities
LARGE2	RFL|APO2|SSC|LFY	The LARGE2-APO1/APO2 regulatory module controls panicle size and grain number in rice	 Genetic analyses support that LARGE2 functions with APO1 and APO2 in a common pathway to regulate panicle size and grain number
