NA	HD-ZIP IV gene Roc8 regulates the size of bulliform cells and lignin content in rice 	2020	Plant Biotechnol J .

The morphology of bulliform cells located on the upper epidermis of leaves is one of the most important cell structures affecting leaf shape. Although many mechanisms regulating the development of bulliform cells have been reported, the fine regulatory mechanisms governing this process have rarely been described. To identify novel components regulating rice leaf morphology, a mutant showing a constitutively rolling phenotype from the seedling stage to flowering, known as crm1-D, was selected for further analysis. Anatomical analyses in crm1-D were attributable to the size reduction of bulliform cells. The crm1-D was controlled by a single dominant nuclear gene. Map-based cloning revealed that Roc8, an HD zipper class IV family member, was responsible for the crm1-D phenotype. Notably, the 50-bp sequence in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the Roc8 gene represses Roc8 at the translational level. Moreover, the roc8 knockdown lines notably increased the size of bulliform cells. A series of assays revealed that Roc8 negatively regulates the size of bulliform cells. Unexpectedly, Roc8 was also observed to positively mediate lignin biosynthesis without incurring a production penalty. The above results show that Roc8 may have a practical application in cultivating materials with high photosynthetic efficiency and low lignin content. 
NA	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Institute of Food Crops, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, China.	Moderately rolled leaf is one of the target traits of the ideal plant architecture in rice breeding. Many genes, including homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factors ROC5 and ROC8, regulating rice leaf rolling have been cloned and functionally analysed. However, the molecular mechanism by which these genes modulate leaf-rolling remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrated the transcription activation activity of both ROC8 and ROC5. Overexpressing ROC8 caused adaxially rolled leaves due to decreased number and size of bulliform cells, whereas knockout of ROC8 induced abaxially rolled leaves due to increased number and size of bulliform cells. ROC8 and ROC5 each could form homodimer, but ROC8 interacted preferably with ROC5 to forms a heterodimer. Importantly, we showed that the ROC8-ROC5 heterodimer rather than the homodimer of ROC8 or ROC5 was functional as neither overexpressing ROC8 in the ROC5 mutant nor overexpressing ROC5 in the ROC8-knockout line could rescue the mutant phenotype. This was further partially supported by the identification of a large number of common differentially expressed genes in single and double mutants of roc8 and roc5. ROC8 and ROC5 were functionally additive as the phenotype of abaxially rolled leaves was stronger in the roc5roc8 double mutant than in their single mutants. Our results provide evidence for the role of dimerization of ROC members in regulating leaf rolling of rice.
