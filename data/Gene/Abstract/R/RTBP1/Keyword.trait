RTBP1	growth	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	rtbp1 plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4)
RTBP1	growth	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	Furthermore, 35S:anti-RTBP1 plants expressing lower levels of RTBP1 mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly
RTBP1	reproductive	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	Furthermore, 35S:anti-RTBP1 plants expressing lower levels of RTBP1 mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly
RTBP1	vegetative	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	rtbp1 plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4)
RTBP1	vegetative	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	Furthermore, 35S:anti-RTBP1 plants expressing lower levels of RTBP1 mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly
RTBP1	architecture	Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice	These results suggest that RTBP1 plays dual roles in rice (Oryza sativa), as both a negative regulator of telomere length and one of positive and functional components for proper architecture of telomeres
