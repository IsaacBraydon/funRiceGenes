Rb1	leaf	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.
Rb1	grain	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 However, overexpression of Rb1 and Rb2 sharply decreased grain filling
Rb1	sheath	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.
Rb1	map-based cloning	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 Map-based cloning and transformation assays further divided PSH1 as two tightly linked bHLH genes, Rb1 and Rb2
Rb1	grain filling	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 However, overexpression of Rb1 and Rb2 sharply decreased grain filling
