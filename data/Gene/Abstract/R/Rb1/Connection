OsC1	Rb1	Dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and two tightly linked genes, Rb1 and Rb2, controls the purple leaf sheath in rice.	 A segregation ratio of green to purple was 15:1 observed in the F(2) population from parents Minghui 63 and Xizang 2, which both had green leaf sheaths; these results demonstrate that dominant complementary interaction between OsC1 and Rb (Rb1 and Rb2) controls the purple leaf sheath
