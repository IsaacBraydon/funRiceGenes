RBS1	flowering time	RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice	 In this study, we characterized the function of the RNA-binding and SPIN1-interacting 1 (RBS1) protein in flowering time regulation| These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice|RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice
RBS1	flower	RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice	 In this study, we characterized the function of the RNA-binding and SPIN1-interacting 1 (RBS1) protein in flowering time regulation| Rbs1 overexpression causes delayed flowering under SD and LD conditions in rice| Expression analyses of flowering marker genes show that Rbs1 overexpression represses the expression of Hd3a under SD and LD conditions| These results suggest that RBS1 is a new negative regulator of flowering time that itself is positively regulated by SPIN1 but negatively regulated by SPL11 in rice|RBS1, an RNA Binding Protein, Interacts with SPIN1 and Is Involved in Flowering Time Control in Rice
