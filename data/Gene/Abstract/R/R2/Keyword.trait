R2	root	Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants	We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
R2	root	Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants	Transcripts of cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, and R2 were detected uniformly in the dividing region of the root apex
R2	temperature	A rice homolog of Cdk7/MO15 phosphorylates both cyclin-dependent protein kinases and the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II	When R2 was overexpressed in a CAK-deficient mutant of budding yeast, it suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mutation
R2	growth	The Rice Cyclin-Dependent Kinase -Activating Kinase R2 Regulates S-Phase Progression	Increasing R2 abundance through a transgenic approach accelerated S-phase progression and overall growth rate in suspension cells
R2	growth	The Rice Cyclin-Dependent Kinase -Activating Kinase R2 Regulates S-Phase Progression	In planta, the CTD kinase activity of R2 was induced by a growth-promoting signal
