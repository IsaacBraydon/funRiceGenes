cdc2Os-2	R2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants	 Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome| However, despite the similarity in structure, both cdc2Os-2 and R2 were unable to complement the same mutant

CDKB2;1|cdc2Os3	R2	Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants	 We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
