RPP10|OsACBP1	phloem	A putative acyl-CoA-binding protein is a major phloem sap protein in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Considering that the content of thioredoxin h, the major phloem sap protein, was 9.4 lg ml1 in phloem sap (Fukuda et al., 2005), this result suggested that RPP10 was also one of the major proteins in rice phloem sap.
