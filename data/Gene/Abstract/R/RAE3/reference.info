Two species of rice have been independently domesticated from different ancestral wild species in Asia and Africa. Comparison of mutations that underlie phenotypic and physiological alterations associated with domestication traits in these species gives insights into the domestication history of rice in both regions. Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa, and African cultivated rice, Oryza glaberrima, have been modified and improved for common traits beneficial for humans, including erect plant architecture, nonshattering seeds, nonpigmented pericarp, and lack of awns. Independent mutations in orthologous genes associated with these traits have been documented in the two cultivated species. Contrary to this prevailing model, selection for awnlessness targeted different genes in O. sativa and O. glaberrima. We identify Regulator of Awn Elongation 3 (RAE3) a gene that encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase and is responsible for the awnless phenotype only in O. glaberrima. A 48-bp deletion may disrupt the substrate recognition domain in RAE3 and diminish awn elongation. Sequencing analysis demonstrated low nucleotide diversity in a ~600-kb region around the derived rae3 allele on chromosome 6 in O. glaberrima compared with its wild progenitor. Identification of RAE3 sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development and provides an example of how selection on different genes can confer the same domestication phenotype in Asian and African rice.
