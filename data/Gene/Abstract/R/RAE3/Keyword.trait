RAE3	development	Regulator of Awn Elongation 3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is responsible for loss of awns during African rice domestication.	 Identification of RAE3 sheds light on the molecular mechanism underlying awn development and provides an example of how selection on different genes can confer the same domestication phenotype in Asian and African rice
