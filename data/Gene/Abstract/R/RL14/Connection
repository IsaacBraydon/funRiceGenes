RL14	SRL2|AVB|NRL2	NARROW AND ROLLED LEAF 2 regulates leaf shape, male fertility, and seed size in rice.	The NRL2 protein interacted with Rolling-leaf (RL14), causing the leaves of the nrl2 mutants to have a higher cellulose content and lower lignin content than the WT, which may have been related to sclerenchymatous cell differentiation and tapetum degeneration
