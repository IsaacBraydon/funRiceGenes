RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	We isolated a pollen-preferential gene, RICE IMMATURE POLLEN 1 (RIP1), from a T-DNA insertional population of japonica rice that was trapped by a promoterless beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene
RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses confirmed that the RIP1 transcript was abundant at the late stages of pollen development
RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	Microscopic analysis demonstrated that development in the rip1 pollen was delayed, starting at the early vacuolated stage
RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	These results indicate that RIP1 is necessary for pollen maturation and germination
RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	Therefore, RIP1 is probably a nuclear protein that may form a functional complex with other proteins and carry out essential cellular and developmental roles during the late stage of pollen formation
RIP1|OsWD40-193	pollen	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development	Rice Immature Pollen 1 (RIP1) is a regulator of late pollen development
RIP1|OsWD40-193	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.
RIP1|OsWD40-193	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 Here, we demonstrated that protein OsWD40-193 interacted with the extension factor OseEF1A1 and both were negative regulators inhibiting rice resistance to H
RIP1|OsWD40-193	resistance	Interaction of negative regulator OsWD40-193 with OseEF1A1 inhibits Oryza sativa resistance to Hirschmanniella mucronata infection.	 mucronata, whereas the absence of OsWD40-193 or OseEF1A1 led to resistance
