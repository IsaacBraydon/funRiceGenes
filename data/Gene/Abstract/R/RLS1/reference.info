Jiao BB-MP 2012.pdf	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	2012	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	Leaf senescence, a type of programmed cell death (PCD) characterized by chlorophyll degradation, is important to plant growth and crop productivity. It emerges that autophagy is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence. However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the process is not well understood. In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified. The rls1 mutant developed small, yellow-brown lesions resembling disease scattered over the whole surfaces of leaves that displayed earlier senescence than those of wild-type plants. The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in rls1. Microscopic observation indicated that PCD was misregulated, probably resulting in the accelerated degradation of chloroplasts in rls1 leaves. Map-based cloning of the RLS1 gene revealed that it encodes a previously uncharacterized NB (nucleotide-binding site)-containing protein with an ARM (armadillo) domain at the carboxyl terminus. Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin. Intriguingly, constitutive expression of RLS1 also slightly accelerated leaf senescence with decreased chlorophyll content in transgenic rice plants. Our study identified a previously uncharacterized NB-ARM protein involved in PCD during plant growth and development, providing a unique tool for dissecting possible autophagy-mediated PCD during senescence in plants.
NA	An activated form of NB-ARC protein RLS1 functions with cysteine-rich receptor-like protein RMC to trigger cell death in rice.	2022	Plant Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, the Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	A key event that follows pathogen recognition by a resistance (R) protein containing an NB-ARC (nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by Apaf-1, R proteins, and Ced-4) domain is hypersensitive response (HR)-type cell death accompanied by accumulation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. However, the integral mechanisms that underlie this process remain relatively opaque. Here, we show that a gain-of-function mutation in the NB-ARC protein RLS1 (Rapid Leaf Senescence 1) triggers high-light-dependent HR-like cell death in rice. The RLS1-mediated defense response is largely independent of salicylic acid accumulation, NPR1 (Nonexpressor of Pathogenesis-Related Gene 1) activity, and RAR1 (Required for Mla12 Resistance 1) function. A screen for suppressors of RLS1 activation identified RMC (Root Meander Curling) as essential for the RLS1-activated defense response. RMC encodes a cysteine-rich receptor-like secreted protein (CRRSP) and functions as an RLS1-binding partner. Intriguingly, their co-expression resulted in a change in the pattern of subcellular localization and was sufficient to trigger cell death accompanied by a decrease in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme APX1. Collectively, our findings reveal an NB-ARC-CRRSP signaling module that modulates oxidative state, the cell death process, and associated immunity responses in rice.
