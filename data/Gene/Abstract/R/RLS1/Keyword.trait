RLS1	cytokinin	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin
RLS1	leaf	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	In this study, the genetic and physiological characteristics of the rice rls1 (rapid leaf senescence 1) mutant were identified
RLS1	leaf	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	The rapid loss of chlorophyll content during senescence was the main cause of accelerated leaf senescence in rls1
RLS1	leaf	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	Consistent with its involvement in leaf senescence, RLS1 was up-regulated during dark-induced leaf senescence and down-regulated by cytokinin
RLS1	leaf	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	Intriguingly, constitutive expression of RLS1 also slightly accelerated leaf senescence with decreased chlorophyll content in transgenic rice plants

RLS1	chloroplast	A novel protein RLS1 with NB-ARM domains is involved in chloroplast degradation during leaf senescence in rice	Microscopic observation indicated that PCD was misregulated, probably resulting in the accelerated degradation of chloroplasts in rls1 leaves
