RPA2c	meiosis	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice	 In this study, we identified RPA2c, a rice gene preferentially expressed during meiosis
RPA2c	meiotic	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice	 RPA2c colocalized with the meiotic cohesion subunit REC8 and the axis-associated protein PAIR2
RPA2c	meiotic	Replication protein A2c coupled with replication protein A1c regulates crossover formation during meiosis in rice	 Our results demonstrate that an RPA complex comprising RPA2c and RPA1c is required to promote meiotic crossovers in rice
