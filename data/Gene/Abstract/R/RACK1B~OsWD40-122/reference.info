Ouyang-2012-Genomic survey, expr.pdf	Genomic survey, expression profile and co-expression network analysis of OsWD40 family in rice	2012	BMC Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research Wuhan, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	BACKGROUND: WD40 proteins represent a large family in eukaryotes, which have been involved in a broad spectrum of crucial functions. Systematic characterization and co-expression analysis of OsWD40 genes enable us to understand the networks of the WD40 proteins and their biological processes and gene functions in rice. RESULTS: In this study, we identify and analyze 200 potential OsWD40 genes in rice, describing their gene structures, genome localizations, and evolutionary relationship of each member. Expression profiles covering the whole life cycle in rice has revealed that transcripts of OsWD40 were accumulated differentially during vegetative and reproductive development and preferentially up or down-regulated in different tissues. Under phytohormone treatments, 25 OsWD40 genes were differentially expressed with treatments of one or more of the phytohormone NAA, KT, or GA3 in rice seedlings. We also used a combined analysis of expression correlation and Gene Ontology annotation to infer the biological role of the OsWD40 genes in rice. The results suggested that OsWD40 genes may perform their diverse functions by complex network, thus were predictive for understanding their biological pathways. The analysis also revealed that OsWD40 genes might interact with each other to take part in metabolic pathways, suggesting a more complex feedback network. CONCLUSIONS: All of these analyses suggest that the functions of OsWD40 genes are diversified, which provide useful references for selecting candidate genes for further functional studies.
Plant Cell-2008-Nakashima-2265-79.pdf	RACK1 functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with the Rac1 immune complex	2008	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma 630-0192, Japan.	A small GTPase, Rac1, plays a key role in rice (Oryza sativa) innate immunity as part of a complex of regulatory proteins. Here, we used affinity column chromatography to identify rice RACK1 (for Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1) as an interactor with Rac1. RACK1 functions in various mammalian signaling pathways and is involved in hormone signaling and development in plants. Rice contains two RACK1 genes, RACK1A and RACK1B, and the RACK1A protein interacts with the GTP form of Rac1. Rac1 positively regulates RACK1A at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. RACK1A transcription was also induced by a fungal elicitor and by abscisic acid, jasmonate, and auxin. Analysis of transgenic rice plants and cell cultures indicates that RACK1A plays a role in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in resistance against rice blast infection. Overexpression of RACK1A enhances ROS production in rice seedlings. RACK1A was shown to interact with the N terminus of NADPH oxidase, RAR1, and SGT1, key regulators of plant disease resistance. These results suggest that RACK1A functions in rice innate immunity by interacting with multiple proteins in the Rac1 immune complex.
NA	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (OsRACK1B) Impairs Fertility in Rice through NADPH-Dependent H(2)O(2) Signaling Pathway.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Biology, Howard University, Washington, DC 20059, USA.	The scaffold protein receptor for Activated C Kinase1 (RACK1) regulates multiple aspects of plants, including seed germination, growth, environmental stress responses, and flowering. Recent studies have revealed that RACK1 is associated with NADPH-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in plants. ROS, as a double-edged sword, can modulate several developmental pathways in plants. Thus, the resulting physiological consequences of perturbing the RACK1 expression-induced ROS balance remain to be explored. Herein, we combined molecular, pharmacological, and ultrastructure analysis approaches to investigate the hypothesized connection using T-DNA-mediated activation-tagged RACK1B overexpressed (OX) transgenic rice plants. In this study, we find that OsRACK1B-OX plants display reduced pollen viability, defective anther dehiscence, and abnormal spikelet morphology, leading to partial spikelet sterility. Microscopic observation of the mature pollen grains from the OX plants revealed abnormalities in the exine and intine structures and decreased starch granules in the pollen, resulting in a reduced number of grains per locule from the OX rice plants as compared to that of the wild-type (WT). Histochemical staining revealed a global increase in hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the leaves and roots of the transgenic lines overexpressing OsRACK1B compared to that of the WT. However, the elevated H(2)O(2) in tissues from the OX plants can be reversed by pre-treatment with diphenylidonium (DPI), an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, indicating that the source of H(2)O(2) could be, in part, NADPH oxidase. Expression analysis showed a differential expression of the NADPH/respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RbohD) and antioxidant enzyme-related genes, suggesting a homeostatic mechanism of H(2)O(2) production and antioxidant enzyme activity. BiFC analysis demonstrated that OsRACK1B interacts with the N-terminal region of RbohD in vivo. Taken together, these data indicate that elevated OsRACK1B accumulates a threshold level of ROS, in this case H(2)O(2), which negatively regulates pollen development and fertility. In conclusion, we hypothesized that an optimal expression of RACK1 is critical for fertility in rice plants.
