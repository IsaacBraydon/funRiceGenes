RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	development	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (OsRACK1B) Impairs Fertility in Rice through NADPH-Dependent H(2)O(2) Signaling Pathway.	 Taken together, these data indicate that elevated OsRACK1B accumulates a threshold level of ROS, in this case H(2)O(2), which negatively regulates pollen development and fertility
RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	fertility	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (OsRACK1B) Impairs Fertility in Rice through NADPH-Dependent H(2)O(2) Signaling Pathway.	 Taken together, these data indicate that elevated OsRACK1B accumulates a threshold level of ROS, in this case H(2)O(2), which negatively regulates pollen development and fertility
RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	pollen	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (OsRACK1B) Impairs Fertility in Rice through NADPH-Dependent H(2)O(2) Signaling Pathway.	 Taken together, these data indicate that elevated OsRACK1B accumulates a threshold level of ROS, in this case H(2)O(2), which negatively regulates pollen development and fertility

RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	transcription factor	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (RACK1B) Delays Salinity-Induced Senescence in Rice Leaves by Regulating Chlorophyll Degradation.	 The results imply that senescence-associated transcription factors (TFs) are altered following altered OsRACK1B expression, indicating a transcriptional reprogramming by OsRACK1B and a novel regulatory mechanism involving the OsRACK1B-OsSGR-TFs complex
RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	senescence	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (RACK1B) Delays Salinity-Induced Senescence in Rice Leaves by Regulating Chlorophyll Degradation.	 Our findings suggest that the ectopic expression of OsRACK1B negatively regulates chlorophyll degradation, leads to a steady level of LHC-II isoform Lhcb1, an essential prerequisite for the state transition of photosynthesis for adaptation, and delays salinity-induced senescence
RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	photosynthesis	Receptor for Activated C Kinase1B (RACK1B) Delays Salinity-Induced Senescence in Rice Leaves by Regulating Chlorophyll Degradation.	 Our findings suggest that the ectopic expression of OsRACK1B negatively regulates chlorophyll degradation, leads to a steady level of LHC-II isoform Lhcb1, an essential prerequisite for the state transition of photosynthesis for adaptation, and delays salinity-induced senescence
