RACK1B|OsWD40-122|OsRACK1B	 The results imply that senescence-associated transcription factors (TFs) are altered following altered OsRACK1B expression, indicating a transcriptional reprogramming by OsRACK1B and a novel regulatory mechanism involving the OsRACK1B-OsSGR-TFs complex |  Our findings suggest that the ectopic expression of OsRACK1B negatively regulates chlorophyll degradation, leads to a steady level of LHC-II isoform Lhcb1, an essential prerequisite for the state transition of photosynthesis for adaptation, and delays salinity-induced senescence
