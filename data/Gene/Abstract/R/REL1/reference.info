NA	Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Leaf morphology, particularly in crop, is one of the most important agronomic traits because it influences the yield through the manipulation of photosynthetic capacity and transpiration. To understand the regulatory mechanism of leaf morphogenesis, an Oryza sativa dominant mutant, rolled and erect leaf 1 (rel1) has been characterized. This mutant has a predominant rolled leaf, increased leaf angle, and reduced plant height phenotype that results in a reduction in grain yield. Electron microscope observations indicated that the leaf incurvations of rel1 dominant mutants result from the alteration of the size and number of bulliform cells. Molecular cloning revealed that the rel1 dominant mutant phenotype is caused by the activation of the REL1 gene, which encodes a novel unknown protein, despite its high degree of conservation among monocot plants. Moreover, the downregulation of the REL1 gene in the rel1 dominant mutant restored the phenotype of this dominant mutant. Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending. Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development. Nevertheless, the responsiveness of both rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing plants to exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) was reduced. Moreover, transcript levels of BR response genes in the rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing lines were significantly altered. Additionally, seven REL1-interacting proteins were also identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen. Taken together, these findings suggest that REL1 regulates leaf morphology, particularly in leaf rolling and bending, through the coordination of BR signalling transduction.
NA	Constitutive expression of REL1 confers the rice response to drought stress and abscisic acid.	2018	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Leaf rolling is one of the most significant symptoms of drought stress in plant. Previously, we identified a dominant negative mutant, termed rolled and erect 1 (hereafter referred to rel1-D), regulating leaf rolling and erectness in rice. However, the role of REL1 in drought response is still poorly understood. Here, our results indicated that rel1-D displayed higher tolerance to drought relative to wild type, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and drought responsive genes were significantly up-regulated in rel1-D. Moreover, our results revealed that rel1-D was hypersensitive to ABA and the expression of ABA associated genes was significantly increased in rel1-D, suggesting that REL1 likely coordinates ABA to regulate drought response. Using the RNA-seq approach, we identified a large group of differentially expressed genes that regulate stimuli and stresses response. Consistently, we also found that constitutive expression of REL1 alters the expression of biotic and abiotic stress responsive genes by the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) analysis. Integrative analysis demonstrated that 8 genes/proteins identified by both RNA-seq and iTRAQ would be the potential targets in term of the REL1-mediated leaf morphology. Together, we proposed that leaf rolling and drought tolerance of rel1-D under normal condition might be caused by the endogenously perturbed homeostasis derived from continuous stressful dynamics.
