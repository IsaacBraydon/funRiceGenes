NA	Multiple Alleles Encoding Atypical NLRs with Unique Central Tandem Repeats in Rice Confer Resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	2020	Plant Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Plants have developed various mechanisms for avoiding pathogen invasion, including resistance (R) genes. Most R genes encode nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing proteins (NLRs). Here, we report the isolation of three new bacterial blight R genes in rice, Xa1-2, Xa14, and Xa31(t), which were allelic to Xa1 and encoded atypical NLRs with unique central tandem repeats (CTRs). We also found that Xa31(t) was the same gene as Xa1-2. Although Xa1-2 and Xa14 conferred different resistance spectra, their performance could be attenuated by iTALEs, as has previously been reported for Xa1. XA1, XA1-2, XA14, and non-resistant RGAF differed mainly in the substructure of the leucine-rich repeat domain. They all contained unique CTRs and belonged to the CTR-NLRs, which existed only in Gramineae. We also found that interactions among these genes led to differing resistance performance. In conclusion, our results uncover a unique locus in rice consisting of at least three multiple alleles (Xa1, Xa1-2, and Xa14) that encode CTR-NLRs and confer resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo).
