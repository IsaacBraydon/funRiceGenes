NA	RGN1 controls grain number and shapes panicle architecture in rice	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Agrobiotechnology / Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	Yield in rice is determined mainly by panicle architecture. Using map-based cloning we identified an R2R3 MYB transcription factor REGULATOR OF GRAIN NUMBER1 (RGN1) affecting grain number and panicle architecture. Mutation of RGN1 caused an absence of lateral grains on secondary branches. We demonstrated that RGN1 controls lateral grain formation by regulation of LONELY GUY (LOG) expression, thus controlling grain number and shaping panicle architecture. A novel favorable allele, RGN1C , derived from the Or-I group in wild rice affected panicle architecture by means longer panicles. Identification of RGN1 provides a theoretical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism of lateral grain formation in rice, RGN1 will be an important gene resource for molecular breeding for higher yield.
