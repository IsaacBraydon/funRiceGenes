OsPIP1;1|RWC1	seed germination	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	 Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	root	Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination	OsPIP1;1 is one of the most abundant aquaporins in rice leaves and roots and is highly responsible to environmental stresses| Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	salt	Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination	" Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate|Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination"
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	seed	Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination	 Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate|Aquaporin OsPIP1;1 promotes rice salt resistance and seed germination
