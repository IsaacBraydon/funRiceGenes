We isolated rice cDNA, rwc1, by screening a rice (Oryza sativa cv. Josaeng Tongil) cDNA library using a conserved motif of aquaporins. Like other aquaporin genes, rwc1 encodes a 290-residue protein with six putative transmembrane domains. The derived amino acid sequence of RWC1 shows high homology with PIP1 (plasma membrane intrinsic protein 1) subfamily members, which suggest it is localized in the plasma membrane. Injection of its cRNA into Xenopus oocytes increased the osmotic water permeability of the oocytes 2-3 times. Northern analysis showed that rice aquaporin genes are expressed in rice seedling leaves and roots, but that it disappeared from the root 6 h after osmotic stress began and that the transcript level remained low for about 24 h, then recovered. The time course of rice aquaporin gene-expression under osmotic stress was correlated with time course of turgor transition in plant. On the other hand, the levels of rice aquaporin gene-transcripts in leaves under chilling and recovery temperature depend on the pretreatment of mannitol for short time. This variation of the transcripts shown that rice aquaporin genes may play an important role in response to water stress-induced chilling tolerance.

OsPIP1;1 is one of the most abundant aquaporins in rice leaves and roots and is highly responsible to environmental stresses. However, its biochemical and physiological functions are still largely unknown. The oocyte assay data showed OsPIP1;1 had lower water channel activity in contrast to OsPIP2;1. EGFP and immunoelectron microscopy studies revealed OsPIP1;1 was predominantly localized in not only plasma membrane but also in some ER-like intracellular compartments in the cells. OsPIP1;1 exhibited low water channel activity in Xenopus oocytes but coexpression of OsPIP2;1 significantly enhanced its water permeability. Stop-flow assay indicated that 10His-OsPIP1;1-reconstituted proteoliposomes had significantly higher water permeability than the control liposomes. Overexpression of OsPIP1;1 greatly altered many physiological features of transgenic plants in a dosage-dependent manner. Moderate expression of OsPIP1;1 increased rice seed yield, salt resistance, root hydraulic conductivity, and seed germination rate. This work suggests OsPIP1;1 functions as an active water channel and plays important physiological roles.
cr200734a.pdf	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	2007	Cell Res	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Previous studies have demonstrated the possible role of several aquaporins in seed germination. But systematic investigation of the role of aquaporin family members in this process is lacking. Here, the developmental regulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) expression throughout germination and post-germination processes in rice embryos was analyzed. The expression patterns of the PIPs suggest these aquaporins play different roles in seed germination and seedling growth. Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions. Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination. Our data also revealed that the nitric oxide (NO) donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), promoted seed germination; furthermore, the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, inhibited germination and reduced the stimulative effects of SNP and GSNO on rice germination. Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds. These results suggest that water channels play an important role in seed germination, acting, at least partly, in response to the NO signaling pathway.
NA	Functional reconstitution of a rice aquaporin water channel, PIP1;1, by a micro-batchwise methodology	2014	Plant Physiol Biochem	Department of Biosciences, Biotechnologies and Biopharmaceutics, University of Bari "Aldo Moro", Bari, Italy.	Assessing the selectivity, regulation and physiological relevance of aquaporin membrane channels (AQPs) requires structural and functional studies of wild type and modified proteins. In particular, when characterizing their transport properties, reconstitution in isolation from native cellular or membrane processes is of pivotal importance. Here, we describe rapid and efficient incorporation of OsPIP1;1, a rice AQP, in liposomes at analytical scale. PIP1;1 was produced as a histidine-tagged form, 10His-OsPIP1;1, in an Escherichia coli-based expression system. The recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and incorporated into liposomes by a micro-batchwise technology using egg-yolk phospholipids and the non-polar Amberlite resin. PIP1;1 proteoliposomes and control empty liposomes had good size homogeneity as seen by quasi-elastic light scattering and electron microscopy analyses. By stopped-flow light scattering, indicating correct protein folding of the incorporated protein, the osmotic water permeability exhibited by the PIP1;1 proteoliposomes was markedly higher than empty liposomes. Functional reconstitution of OsPIP1;1 was further confirmed by the low Arrhenius activation energy (3.37 kcal/mol) and sensitivity to HgCl2, a known AQP blocker, of the PIP1;1-mediated osmotic water conductance. These results provide a valuable contribution in fully elucidating the regulation and water-conducting property of PIP1;1, an AQP that needs to hetero-multimerize with AQPs of the PIP2 subgroup to reach the native plasma membrane and play its role. The micro-batchwise methodology is suitable for the functional reconstitution of whichever AQPs and other membrane transport proteins.
