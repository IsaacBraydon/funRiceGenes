OsRACK1A	salt	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	 OsRACK1A was found to follow a rhythmic expression profile under circadian conditions at both the transcription and the translation levels, although the expression was arrhythmic under salt stress
OsRACK1A	salt	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	 Analysis of plant survival rates, fresh weight, proline content, malondialdehyde, and chlorophyll showed that suppression of OsRACK1A enhanced tolerance to salt stress
OsRACK1A	salt	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	 We identified putative interactors of OsRACK1A, and found that OsRACK1A interacted with many salt stress-responsive proteins directly
OsRACK1A	salt	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	 These results suggest that OsRACK1A is regulated by circadian rhythm, and involved in the regulation of salt stress responses
OsRACK1A	tolerance	OsRACK1A, encodes a circadian clock-regulated WD40 protein, negatively affect salt tolerance in rice.	 Analysis of plant survival rates, fresh weight, proline content, malondialdehyde, and chlorophyll showed that suppression of OsRACK1A enhanced tolerance to salt stress
