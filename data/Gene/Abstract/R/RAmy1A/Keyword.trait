AmyI-1|RAmy1A	seed	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds
AmyI-1|RAmy1A	gibberellin	Functional dissection of a sugar-repressed α-amylase gene (RAmy1A) promoter in rice embryos	The gibberellin-inducible rice α-amylase gene, RAmy1A, was demonstrated to be sugar repressed in rice embryos and functional dissection of the promoter of RAmy1A in relation of its sugar-modulated expression was performed
