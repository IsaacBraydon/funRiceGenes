AmyI-1|RAmy1A	starch	The rice alpha-amylase glycoprotein is targeted from the Golgi apparatus through the secretory pathway to the plastids	The well-characterized secretory glycoprotein, rice (Oryza sativa) alpha-amylase isoform I-1 (AmyI-1), was localized within the plastids and proved to be involved in the degradation of starch granules in the organelles of rice cells
AmyI-1|RAmy1A	gibberellin	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone
AmyI-1|RAmy1A	transcription factor	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone	Functional dissections between GAMYB and Dof transcription factors suggest a role for protein-protein associations in the gibberellin-mediated expression of the RAmy1A gene in the rice aleurone
AmyI-1|RAmy1A	seed	Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds	 CARE and GARE were also found in the promoters of a rice alpha-amylase gene, RAmy1A, and a barley proteinase gene, EPB1, which are expressed in germinating seeds
AmyI-1|RAmy1A	gibberellin	Functional dissection of a sugar-repressed α-amylase gene (RAmy1A) promoter in rice embryos	The gibberellin-inducible rice α-amylase gene, RAmy1A, was demonstrated to be sugar repressed in rice embryos and functional dissection of the promoter of RAmy1A in relation of its sugar-modulated expression was performed
