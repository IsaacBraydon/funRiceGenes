MER3|RCK	sterile	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	meiosis	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants
MER3|RCK	meiosis	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
MER3|RCK	vegetative	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	meiotic	OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis	 Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
MER3|RCK	vegetative	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	 The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects
MER3|RCK	flower	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	flower	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants
MER3|RCK	meiotic	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice
MER3|RCK	meiotic	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation
MER3|RCK	meiotic	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
MER3|RCK	meiotic	The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis	 OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
MER3|RCK	meiotic	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
MER3|RCK	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
MER3|RCK	meiotic	The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis	 Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
MER3|RCK	sterility	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	 The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects
MER3|RCK	pollen	MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice	 Cytological analyses show that chiasma frequency is reduced dramatically in mer3 mutants and the remaining chiasmata distribute randomly among different pollen mother cells, implying possible coexistence of two kinds of crossover in rice
MER3|RCK	pollen	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	fertility	Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice	 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens
MER3|RCK	meiosis	OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice	 In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
