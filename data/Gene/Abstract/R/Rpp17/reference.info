Plant Cell Physiol-2002-Asano-668-74.pdf	Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues	2002	Plant and Cell Physiology	Genetic Diversity Department, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan	The genes for two types of rice phloem protein (RPP16 and RPP17) were isolated and characterized. Conservation of five exon sizes as well as splicing positions between the two genes suggest that either RPP16 or RPP17 is a resultant of gene duplication. By protein blot analysis, RPP16 and RPP17 proteins were specifically detected in soluble and insoluble fractions of a crude extract of rice plants, respectively, suggesting that these proteins play different roles in individual cells. The expression of Rpp16 and Rpp17 was monitored by the Î²-glucuronidase (gusA) reporter-gene method. Rpp16-gusA and Rpp17-gusA were expressed preferentially in the phloem tissues from different parts of the plant, but almost no GUS staining was observed in the rest of the tissues. In roots of both constructs, interestingly, stronger GUS-accumulation was detected in younger vascular tissues than in aged vascular tissues. In situ hybridization also showed that Rpp17 was more strongly expressed in vascular tissues of tiller buds. These results suggest that transcript of these genes was more abundant in young tissues. The presence of two copies of the gene in higher plants, from a common origin, which have different protein characteristics, indicates that evolutionary diversification might have occurred in the gene function.
NA	Rice C2-domain proteins are induced and translocated to the plasma membrane in response to a fungal elicitor	2003	Biochemistry	Division of Applied Life Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Korea	Hundreds of proteins involved in signaling pathways contain a Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-binding motif called the C2-domain. However, no small C2-domain proteins consisting of a single C2-domain have been reported in animal cells. We have isolated two cDNA clones, OsERG1a and OsERG1b, that encode two small C2-domain proteins of 156 and 159 amino acids, respectively, from a fungal elicitor-treated rice cDNA library. The clones are believed to have originated from a single gene by alternative splicing. Transcript levels of the OsERG1 gene are dramatically elevated by a fungal elicitor prepared from Magnaporthe grisea or by Ca(2+) ions. The OsERG1 protein produced in Escherichia coli binds to phospholipid vesicles in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and is translocated to the plasma membrane of plant cells by treatment with either a fungal elicitor or a Ca(2+) ionophore. These results suggest that OsERG1 proteins containing a single C2-domain are involved in plant defense signaling systems.
NA	Identification of rice blast fungal elicitor-responsive genes by differential display analysis	2000	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Biochemistry, Gyeongsang National University, Chinju, Korea.	In order to study molecular interactions that occur between rice and rice blast fungus upon infection, we isolated fungal elicitor-responsive genes from rice (Oryza sativa cv. Milyang 117) suspension-cultured cells treated with fungal elicitor prepared from the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) employing a method that combined mRNA differential display and cDNA library screening. Data base searches with the isolated cDNA clones revealed that the OsERG1 and OsERG2 cDNAs share significant similarities with the mammalian Ca2+-dependent lipid binding (C2) domains. The OsCPX1 cDNA is highly homologous to peroxidases. The OsHin1 cDNA exhibits homology to the tobacco hin1 gene, whose expression is induced by avirulent pathogens. The OsLPL1 and OsMEK1 cDNAs share homologies with lysophospholipases and serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinases, respectively. The OsWRKY1 and OsEREBP1 cDNAs are homologous to transcription factors, such as the WRKY protein family and the AP2/EREBP family, respectively. Transcripts of the OsERG1, OsHin1, and OsMEK1 genes were specifically elevated only in response to the avirulent race KJ301 of the rice blast fungus. Our study yielded a number of elicitor-responsive genes that will not only provide molecular probes, but also contribute to our understanding of host defense mechanisms against the rice blast fungus.
