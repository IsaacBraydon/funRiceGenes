Rpp17|OsERG1	tiller	Rpp16 and Rpp17, from a Common Origin, have Different Protein Characteristics but Both Genes are Predominantly Expressed in Rice Phloem Tissues	 In situ hybridization also showed that Rpp17 was more strongly expressed in vascular tissues of tiller buds
Rpp17	plant defense signaling	Rice C2-domain proteins are induced and translocated to the plasma membrane in response to a fungal elicitor	These results suggest that OsERG1 proteins containing a single C2-domain are involved in plant defense signaling systems.
