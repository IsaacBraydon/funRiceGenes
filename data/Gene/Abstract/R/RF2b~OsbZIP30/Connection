RF2a|OsbZIP75	RF2b|OsbZIP30	RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease	 RF2b, identified by its interaction with RF2a, binds to Box II in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF2a/RF2b heterodimers| Like RF2a, RF2b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants| Both RF2a and RF2b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues| However, RF2a and RF2b have different DNA-binding affinities to Box II, show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization| We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the Box II cis element with multiple host factors, including RF2a and RF2b|RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease
RF2a|OsbZIP75	RF2b|OsbZIP30	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease	 Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development| Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF2a and RF2b had essentially no impact on plant development| Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration|Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease
