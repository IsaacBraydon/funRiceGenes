RF2b|OsbZIP30	leaf	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease	 Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration
RF2b|OsbZIP30	disease	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease
RF2b|OsbZIP30	disease	RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease	 Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF2b exhibit a disease-like phenotype|RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease
RF2b|OsbZIP30	transcription factor	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease	 Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development|Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease
