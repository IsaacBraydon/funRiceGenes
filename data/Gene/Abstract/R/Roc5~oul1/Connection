PFL	Roc5|oul1	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1
PFL	Roc5|oul1	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 Many genes, including homeodomain leucine zipper IV transcription factors ROC5 and ROC8, regulating rice leaf rolling have been cloned and functionally analysed
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 In this study, we demonstrated the transcription activation activity of both ROC8 and ROC5
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 ROC8 and ROC5 each could form homodimer, but ROC8 interacted preferably with ROC5 to forms a heterodimer
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 Importantly, we showed that the ROC8-ROC5 heterodimer rather than the homodimer of ROC8 or ROC5 was functional as neither overexpressing ROC8 in the ROC5 mutant nor overexpressing ROC5 in the ROC8-knockout line could rescue the mutant phenotype
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 This was further partially supported by the identification of a large number of common differentially expressed genes in single and double mutants of roc8 and roc5
Roc5|oul1	Roc8	Heterodimer formed by ROC8 and ROC5 modulates leaf rolling in rice	 ROC8 and ROC5 were functionally additive as the phenotype of abaxially rolled leaves was stronger in the roc5roc8 double mutant than in their single mutants
