1589.pdf	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	2011	Plant Physiol	Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, People's Republic of China.	Leaf rolling is considered an important agronomic trait in rice (Oryza sativa) breeding. To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling. The phenotypes were caused by knockout of Rice outermost cell-specific gene5 (Roc5), an ortholog of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene GLABRA2. Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling. Bulliform cell number and size increased in oul1 and Roc5 cosuppression plants but were reduced in Roc5-overexpressing lines. The data indicate that Roc5 negatively regulates bulliform cell fate and development. Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1. The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function. These are, to our knowledge, the first functional data for a gene encoding a homeodomain leucine zipper class IV transcriptional factor in rice that modulates leaf rolling.
NA	Curled Flag Leaf 2, Encoding a Cytochrome P450 Protein, Regulated by the Transcription Factor Roc5, Influences Flag Leaf Development in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Rice Research Institute, Southwest University, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chongqing, China.	Moderate curling generally causes upright leaf blades, which favors the establishment of ideal plant architecture and increases the photosynthetic efficiency of the population, both of which are desirable traits for super hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we identified a novel curled-leaf mutant, curled flag leaf 2 (cfl2), which shows specific curling at the base of the flag leaf owing to abnormal epidermal development, caused by enlarged bulliform cells and increased number of papillae with the disordered distribution. Map-based cloning reveals that CFL2 encodes a cytochrome P450 protein and corresponds to the previously reported OsCYP96B4. CFL2 was expressed in all analyzed tissues with differential abundance and was downregulated in the clf1 mutant [a mutant harbors a mutation in the homeodomain leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) transcription factor Roc5]. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays confirm that Roc5 could directly bind to the cis-element L1 box in the promoter of CFL2 before activating CFL2 expression. RNA sequencing reveals that genes associated with cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall-related processes were significantly upregulated in the cfl2 mutant. The components of cell wall, such as lignin, cellulose, and some kinds of monosaccharide, were altered dramatically in the cfl2 mutant when compared with wild-type "Jinhui10" (WT). Taken together, CFL2, as a target gene of Roc5, plays an important role in the regulation of flag leaf shape by influencing epidermis and cell wall development.
