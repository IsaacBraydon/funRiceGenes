Roc5|oul1	leaf rolling	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	 Interestingly, overexpression of Roc5 led to adaxially rolled leaves, whereas cosuppression of Roc5 resulted in abaxial leaf rolling|Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice
Roc5|oul1	leaf	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	 To understand the molecular mechanism controlling leaf rolling, we screened a rice T-DNA insertion population and isolated the outcurved leaf1 (oul1) mutant showing abaxial leaf rolling
