005247.pdf	RF2a, a bZIP transcriptional activator of the phloem-specific rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter, functions in vascular development	1997	EMBO J	Division of Plant Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, BCC206, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.	Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) replicates only in phloem cells in infected rice plants and its promoter drives strong phloem-specific reporter gene expression in transgenic rice plants. We isolated a cDNA encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, RF2a, which binds to the Box II cis element that is important for expression from the promoter. RF2a, which stimulates Box II-dependent transcription in a homologous in vitro transcription system, accumulates in nuclei of phloem and certain other cell types in shoots, but is found at only very low levels in roots. Transgenic antisense plants in which RF2a accumulation was suppressed had normal roots but stunted, twisted leaves with small, disorganized vascular bundles, an enlarged sclerenchyma and large air spaces. We propose that the RTBV promoter exploits a host transcription factor that is critical for leaf tissue differentiation and vascular development for its expression.
10.1007-s11741-009-0216-3.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of basic leucine zipper transcription factor families in Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Populus trichocarpa	2009	Journal of Shanghai University (English Edition)	School of Life Sciences, Shanghai University, Shanghai, 200444, P. R. China	The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors form a large gene family that is important in pathogen defense, light and stress signaling, etc. The Completed whole genome sequences of model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa) constitute a valuable resource for genome-wide analysis and genomic comparative analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. In this study, bioinformatics analysis identified 74, 89 and 88 bZIP genes respectively in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar. Moreover, a comprehensive overview of this gene family is presented, including the gene structure, phylogeny, chromosome distribution, conserved motifs. As a result, the plant bZIPs were organized into 10 subfamilies on basis of phylogenetic relationship. Gene duplication events during the family evolution history were also investigated. And it was further concluded that chromosomal/segmental duplication might have played a key role in gene expansion of bZIP gene family.
J. Biol. Chem.-2003-Dai-36396-402.pdf	Functional analysis of RF2a, a rice transcription factor	2003	J Biol Chem	Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, St. Louis, Missouri 63132, USA.	RF2a is a bZIP transcription factor that regulates expression of the promoter of rice tungro bacilliform badnavirus. RF2a is predicted to include three domains that contribute to its function. The results of transient assays with mutants of RF2a from which one or more domains were removed demonstrated that the acidic domain was essential for the activation of gene expression, although the proline-rich and glutamine-rich domains each played a role in this function. Studies using fusion proteins of different functional domains of RF2a with the 2C7 synthetic zinc finger DNA-binding domain showed that the acidic region is a relatively strong activation domain, the function of which is dependent on the context in which the domain is placed. Data from transgenic plants further supported the conclusion that the acidic domain was important for maintaining the biological function of RF2a. RF2a and TBP (TATA-binding protein) synergistically activate transcription in vitro (Zhu, Q., Ordiz, M. I., Dabi, T., Beachy, R. N., and Lamb, C. (2002) Plant Cell 14, 795-803). In vitro and in vivo assays showed that RF2a interacts with TBP through the glutamine-rich domain but not the acidic domain. Functional analysis of such interactions indicates that the acidic domain activates transcription through mechanisms other than via the direct recruitment of TBP.

Rice transcription factor RF2a binds to the BoxII cis element of the promoter of rice tungro bacilliform virus and activates promoter expression. The acidic acid-rich domain of RF2a is a transcription activator and has been partially characterized (Dai et al., 2003). The RF2a acidic domain (A; amino acids 49-116) was fused with the synthetic zinc finger ZF-TF 2C7 and was co-introduced with a reporter gene into transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Expression of the reporter gene was increased up to seven times by the effector. In transient assays in tobacco BY-2 protoplasts, we identified a subdomain comprising amino acids 56-84 (A5) that was equally as effective as an activator as the entire acidic domain. A chemically inducible system was used to show determined that A and A5 domains are equally as effective in transcription activation as the well-characterized VP16 activation domain. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that the A5 domain is present only in b-ZIP transcription factors. In dicots, the A domain contains an insertion of four amino acids that is not present in monocot proteins. The A5 domain, and similar domains in other b-ZIP transcription factors, is predicted to form an anti-parallel beta sheet structure.
Nijhawan-2008-Genomic survey and g.pdf	Genomic survey and gene expression analysis of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor family in rice	2008	Plant Physiol	Interdisciplinary Centre for Plant Genomics and Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.	The basic leucine (Leu) zipper (bZIP) proteins compose a family of transcriptional regulators present exclusively in eukaryotes. The bZIP proteins characteristically harbor a bZIP domain composed of two structural features: a DNA-binding basic region and the Leu zipper dimerization region. They have been shown to regulate diverse plant-specific phenomena, including seed maturation and germination, floral induction and development, and photomorphogenesis, and are also involved in stress and hormone signaling. We have identified 89 bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in the rice (Oryza sativa) genome. Their chromosomal distribution and sequence analyses suggest that the bZIP transcription factor family has evolved via gene duplication. The phylogenetic relationship among rice bZIP domains as well as with bZIP domains from other plant bZIP factors suggests that homologous bZIP domains exist in plants. Similar intron/exon structural patterns were observed in the basic and hinge regions of their bZIP domains. Detailed sequence analysis has been done to identify additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain and to predict their DNA-binding site specificity as well as dimerization properties, which has helped classify them into different groups and subfamilies, respectively. Expression of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes has been analyzed by full-length cDNA and expressed sequence tag-based expression profiling. This expression profiling was complemented by microarray analysis. The results indicate specific or coexpression patterns of rice bZIP transcription factors starting from floral transition to various stages of panicle and seed development. bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice also displayed differential expression patterns in rice seedlings in response to abiotic stress and light irradiation. An effort has been made to link the structure and expression pattern of bZIP transcription factor-encoding genes in rice to their function, based on the information obtained from our analyses and earlier known results. This information will be important for functional characterization of bZIP transcription factors in rice.
PC14040795.pdf	Rice TATA Binding Protein Interacts Functionally with Transcription Factor IIB and the RF2a bZIP Transcriptional Activator in an Enhanced Plant in Vitro Transcription System	2002	The Plant Cell Online	Plant Biology Laboratory, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.	TATA binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) are key factors for the assembly of eukaryotic transcription initiation complexes. We used a rice whole-cell extract in vitro transcription system to characterize the functional interactions of recombinant plant TBP and TFIIB. Bacterially expressed rice TBP (OsTBP2) bound to the TATA box of the rice pal gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, caused DNA bending, and enhanced basal transcription from the pal promoter in a TATA box-dependent manner. Recombinant rice TFIIB (OsTFIIB) stimulated the DNA binding and bending activities of OsTBP2 and synergistically enhanced OsTBP2-mediated transcription from the pal promoter and the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus but not from the barley pr1 promoter. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between OsTBP2 and RF2a, a rice bZIP transcription factor that bound to the box II cis element of the promoter of Rice tungro bacilliform virus, resulting in enhanced transcription from the viral promoter. Enhancement of rice whole-cell extracts with recombinant transcription factors thus provides a powerful tool for the in vitro determination of plant gene regulation mechanisms. We conclude that OsTBP2 undergoes promoter-specific functional interactions with both the basal transcription factor OsTFIIB and the accessory transcription factor RF2a.
PNAS-2001-Petruccelli-7635-40.pdf	Transcription factor RF2a alters expression of the rice tungro bacilliform virus promoter in transgenic tobacco plants	2001	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.	The promoter from rice tungro bacilliform badnavirus (RTBV) is expressed only in phloem tissues in transgenic rice plants. RF2a, a b-Zip protein from rice, is known to bind to the Box II cis element near the TATA box of the promoter. Here, we report that the full-length RTBV promoter and a truncated fragment E of the promoter, comprising nucleotides -164 to +45, result in phloem-specific expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter genes in transgenic tobacco plants. When a fusion gene comprising the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and RF2a cDNA was coexpressed with the GUS reporter genes, GUS activity was increased by 2-20-fold. The increase in GUS activity was positively correlated with the amount of RF2a, and the expression pattern of the RTBV promoter was altered from phloem-specific to constitutive. Constitutive expression of RF2a did not induce morphological changes in the transgenic plants. In contrast, constitutive overexpression of the b-ZIP domain of RF2a had a strong effect on the development of transgenic plants. These studies suggest that expression of the b-Zip domain can interfere with the function of homologues of RF2a that regulate development of tobacco plants.
PNAS-2004-Dai-687-92.pdf	RF2b, a rice bZIP transcription activator, interacts with RF2a and is involved in symptom development of rice tungro disease	2004	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, 975 North Warson Road, St. Louis, MO 63132, USA.	The phloem-specific promoter of rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) is regulated in part by sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that bind to Box II, an essential cis element. Previous studies demonstrated that the bZIP protein RF2a is involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTBV promoter. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of a second bZIP protein, RF2b. RF2b, identified by its interaction with RF2a, binds to Box II in in vitro assays as a homodimer and as RF2a/RF2b heterodimers. Like RF2a, RF2b activates the RTBV promoter in transient assays and in transgenic tobacco plants. Both RF2a and RF2b are predominantly expressed in vascular tissues. However, RF2a and RF2b have different DNA-binding affinities to Box II, show distinctive expression patterns in different rice organs, and exhibit different patterns of subcellular localization. Furthermore, transgenic rice plants with reduced levels of RF2b exhibit a disease-like phenotype. We propose that the regulation of phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter and potentially the control of RTBV replication are mainly achieved via interactions of the Box II cis element with multiple host factors, including RF2a and RF2b. We also propose that quenching/titration of these and perhaps other transcription factors by RTBV is involved in the development of the symptoms of rice tungro disease.
PNAS-2008-Dai-21012-6.pdf	Transgenic rice plants that overexpress transcription factors RF2a and RF2b are tolerant to rice tungro virus replication and disease	2008	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, 975 North Warson Road, St. Louis, MO 63132, USA. sdai@danforthcenter.org	Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a significant yield constraint in rice-growing areas of South and Southeast Asia. Disease symptoms are caused largely by infection by the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). Two host transcription factors, RF2a and RF2b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF2a and RF2b had essentially no impact on plant development. Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF2a or RF2b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration. Furthermore, transgenic plants exhibited reduced accumulation of RTBV RNA and viral DNA compared with nontransgenic plants. Similar results were obtained in studies after virus inoculation by green leafhoppers. Gaining disease resistance by elevating the expression of host regulators provides another strategy against RTD and may have implications for other pararetrovirus infections.
