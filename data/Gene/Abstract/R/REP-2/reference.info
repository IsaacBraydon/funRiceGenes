Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is known to be a key player in apoptosis in animals. The components and pathways regulating H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death in plants, however, remain largely unknown. In the present study, rice transgenic lines overexpressing Bcl-2, a human apoptotic suppressor, were obtained. These transgenic lines showed increased tolerance to high levels of H(2)O(2), resulting in increased seed germination rates, root elongation, root tip cell viability and chlorophyll retention compared to control lines. In the control lines, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in DNA laddering and a clear terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling signal, which are the hallmarks of programmed cell death. However, this effect was not detected in the Bcl-2-overexpressing transgenic lines. Further investigations indicated that Bcl-2 suppressed H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death but did not inhibit stress-elicited reactive oxygen species production in rice. RT-PCR revealed that the expression of the two vacuolar processing enzyme genes (i.e. OsVPE2 and OsVPE3) was dramatically induced by H(2)O(2) in the wild-type line but not in the Bcl-2-overexpressing line. Moreover, treatment with H(2)O(2) resulted in the disruption of the vacuolar membrane in the wild-type line. The expression levels of OsVPE1 and OsVPE4 did not significantly differ between the wild-type line and the transgenic line that was treated or untreated with H(2)O(2). The similar roles of Bcl-2 and OsVPEs during endogenous reactive oxygen species-triggered programmed cell death were also confirmed by NaCl stress in rice. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonsatrate that Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits H(2)O(2)-induced programmed cell death and enhances H(2)O(2) tolerance. We propose that Bcl-2 overexpression in rice suppresses the transcriptional activation of OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not of OsVPE1 or OsVPE4.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00425-003-1024-5.pdf	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2	2003	Planta	Department of Biological Sciences, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Minami-ohsawa 1-1, Hachioji-shi, 192-0397 Tokyo, Japan.	We previously showed that two major cysteine endopeptidases, REP-1 and REP-2, were present in germinated rice ( Oryza sativa L.) seeds, and that REP-1 was the enzyme that digests seed storage proteins. The present study shows that REP-2 is an asparaginyl endopeptidase that acts as an activator of REP-1, and we separated it into two forms, REP-2alpha (39 kDa) and REP-2beta (40 kDa), using ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. Although analysis of the amino terminals revealed that 10 amino acids of both forms were identical, their isoelectric points were different. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using an antiserum raised against legumain, an asparaginyl endopeptidase from jack bean, indicated that both forms were present in maturing and germinating rice seeds, and that their amounts transiently decreased in dry seeds. Northern blot analysis indicated that REP-2 mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds. In germinating seeds, the mRNA was detected in aleurone layers but not in shoot and root tissues. Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10(-6) M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas REP-2beta levels declined rapidly. Southern blot analysis showed that there is one gene for REP-2 in the genome, indicating that both REP-2 enzymes are generated from a single gene. The structure of the gene was similar to that of beta-VPE and gamma-VPE isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana.
NA	Suppression of OsVPE3 Enhances Salt Tolerance by Attenuating Vacuole Rupture during Programmed Cell Death and Affects Stomata Development in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	Institute of Genetics and Regenerative Biology, Key Laboratory for Cell and Gene Engineering of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) are cysteine proteinases that act as crucial mediators of programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. In rice, however, the role of VPEs in abiotic stress-induced PCD remains largely unknown. In this study, we generated OsVPE3 overexpression and suppression transgenic lines to elucidate the function of this gene in rice.Survival rate and chlorophyll retention analyses showed that suppression of OsVPE3 clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance in transgenic rice compared with wild type. Furthermore, fragmentation of genomic DNA was inhibited in plants with down-regulated OsVPE3. Vital staining studies indicated that vacuole rupture occurred prior to plasma membrane collapse during salt-induced PCD. Notably, overexpression of OsVPE3 promoted vacuole rupture, whereas suppression of OsVPE3 attenuated or delayed the disintegration of vacuolar membranes. Moreover, we found that suppression of OsVPE3 caused decreased leaf width and guard cell length in rice.Taken together, these results indicated that suppression of OsVPE3 enhances salt tolerance by attenuating vacuole rupture during PCD. Therefore, we concluded that OsVPE3 plays a crucial role in vacuole-mediated PCD and in stomatal development in rice.
