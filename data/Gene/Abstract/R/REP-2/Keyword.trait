OsVPE3|REP-2	seed	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2	 Northern blot analysis indicated that REP-2 mRNA was expressed in both maturing and germinating seeds
OsVPE3|REP-2	seed	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2	 Incubation of the de-embryonated seeds in 10(-6) M gibberellic acid induced the production of large amounts of REP-1, whereas REP-2beta levels declined rapidly
OsVPE3|REP-2	seed	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2	Identification, cDNA cloning and possible roles of seed-specific rice asparaginyl endopeptidase, REP-2
OsVPE3|REP-2	cell death	Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice	Bcl-2 suppresses hydrogen peroxide-induced programmed cell death via OsVPE2 and OsVPE3, but not via OsVPE1 and OsVPE4, in rice
