Rf1a|Rf5	RF6	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.
Rf1a|Rf5	RF6	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.	 Molecular mapping results revealed that these genes were Rf5 and Rf6, which are the Rf genes that restore fertility to Honglian-type CMS lines
Rf1a|Rf5	RF6	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.	 The BT-type F(1) hybrids with either Rf5 or Rf6 exhibited normal seed setting rates, but F(1) plants carrying Rf6 showed more stable seed setting rates than those of plants carrying Rf5 under heat-stress conditions
Rf1a|Rf5	RF6	Ability of Rf5 and Rf6 to Restore Fertility of Chinsurah Boro II-type Cytoplasmic Male Sterile Oryza Sativa (ssp. Japonica) Lines.	 Furthermore, the seed setting rates of F(1) hybrids carrying both Rf5 and Rf6 were more stable than that of F(1) plants carrying only one Rf gene
