10.1007-s10529-006-9152-1.pdf	A metallothionein-like protein of rice (rgMT) functions in E. coli and its gene expression is induced by abiotic stresses	2006	Biotechnol Lett	Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Stress Molecular Biology Laboratory, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, P. R. China.	A metallothionein-like (rgMT) gene was isolated from a rice (Oryza sativa L.) root cDNA library that was prepared from plants grown under NaHCO3 stress. The rgMT gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several abiotic stresses from salts (NaCl and NaHCO3), drought (PEG) and metals (CuCl2, ZnCl2, CdCl2). The results suggested that the rgMT gene was expressed in response to environmental stresses. The rgMT gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the final yield of the purified rgMT protein was 4.8 mg g(-1) dry cells. Tolerance of E. coli expressing GST-rgMT fusion protein to Cu2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ was enhanced, and cells dry weight increased 0.04 mg, 0.17 mg and 0.07 mg in 1 ml culture treated with either CuCl2, ZnCl2 or CdCl2, respectively, compared with control after 6 h culture.
10.1007-s11103-009-9466-1.pdf	OsMT1a, a type 1 metallothionein, plays the pivotal role in zinc homeostasis and drought tolerance in rice	2009	Plant Mol Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Centre for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China.	Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that may be involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification in both plants and animals. OsMT1a, encoding a type 1 metallothionein, was isolated via suppression subtractive hybridization from Brazilian upland rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Iapar 9). Expression analysis revealed that OsMT1a predominantly expressed in the roots, and was induced by dehydration. Interestingly, the OsMT1a expression was also induced specifically by Zn(2+) treatment. Both transgenic plants and yeasts harboring OsMT1a accumulated more Zn(2+) than wild type controls, suggesting OsMT1a is most likely to be involved in zinc homeostasis. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsMT1a demonstrated enhanced tolerance to drought. The examination of antioxidant enzyme activities demonstrated that catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were significantly elevated in transgenic plants. Furthermore, the transcripts of several Zn(2+)-induced CCCH zinc finger transcription factors accumulated in OsMT1a transgenic plants, suggesting that OsMT1a not only participates directly in ROS scavenging pathway but also regulates expression of the zinc finger transcription factors via the alteration of Zn(2+) homeostasis, which leads to improved plant stress tolerance.
NA	Identification of a new function of metallothionein-like gene OsMT1e for cadmium detoxification and potential phytoremediation	2021	Chemosphere	Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Cadmium (Cd) is a biologically non-essential and toxic heavy metal leaking to the environment via natural emission or anthropogenic activities, thereby contaminating crops and threatening human health. Metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of metal-binding proteins playing critical roles in metal allocation and homeostasis. In this study, we identified a novel function of OsMT1e from rice plants. OsMT1e was dominantly expressed in roots at all developmental stages and, to less extent, expressed in leaves at vegetative and seed filling stages. OsMT1e was mainly targeted to the nucleus and substantially induced by Cd exposure. Expression of OsMT1e in a yeast Cd-sensitive strain ycf1 conferred cellular tolerance to Cd, even though the ycf1 + OsMT1e cells accumulated more Cd than the control cells (ycf1 + pYES2). Both transgenic rice overexpressing (OX) and repressing OsMT1e by RNA interference (RNAi) were developed. Phenotypic analysis revealed that OsMT1e overexpression enhanced the rice growth concerning the increased shoot or root elongation, dry weight and chlorophyll contents, whereas the RNAi lines displayed a sensitive growth phenotype compared to wild-type. Assessment with 0.5, 2 and 10 μM Cd for two weeks revealed that the RNAi lines accumulated less Cd, while the OX lines had an increased Cd accumulation in root and shoot tissues. The contrasting Cd accumulation phenotypes between the OX and RNAi lines were further confirmed by a long-term study with 0.5 μM Cd for one month. Overall, the study unveiled a new function of OsMT1e in rice, which can be potentially used for engineering genotypes for phytoremediation or minimizing Cd in rice crops.
