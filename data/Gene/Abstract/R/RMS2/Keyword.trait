RMS2|OsGELP34	anther	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	 RMS2 was map-based cloned as an endoplasmic reticulum-localized GDSL lipase gene, which is predominantly transcribed during early anther development
RMS2|OsGELP34	development	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	 RMS2 was map-based cloned as an endoplasmic reticulum-localized GDSL lipase gene, which is predominantly transcribed during early anther development
RMS2|OsGELP34	homeostasis	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.
RMS2|OsGELP34	fertility	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	 Furthermore, RMS2 is directly targeted by male fertility regulators Undeveloped Tapetum 1 (UDT1) and Persistent Tapetal Cell 1 (PTC1) both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RMS2 may serve as a key node in the rice male fertility regulatory network
