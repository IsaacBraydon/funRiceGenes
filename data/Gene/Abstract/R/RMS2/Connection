PTC1|OsMS1	RMS2	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	 Furthermore, RMS2 is directly targeted by male fertility regulators Undeveloped Tapetum 1 (UDT1) and Persistent Tapetal Cell 1 (PTC1) both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RMS2 may serve as a key node in the rice male fertility regulatory network
