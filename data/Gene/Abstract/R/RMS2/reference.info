NA	RMS2 encoding a GDSL lipase mediates lipid homeostasis in anthers to determine rice male fertility.	2020	Plant Physiol	China national rice research institute CITY: Hangzhou STATE: Zhejiang China [CN].	Plant male gametogenesis is a coordinated effort involving both reproductive tissues and sporophytic tissues, in which lipid metabolism plays an essential role. Although GDSL esterases/lipases have been well known as key enzymes for many plant developmental processes and stress responses, their functions in reproductive development remain unclear. Here, we report the identification of a rice male sterile 2 (rms2) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which is completely male sterile due to the defects in tapetum degradation, cuticle formation in sporophytic tissues, and impaired exine and central vacuole development in pollen grains. RMS2 was map-based cloned as an endoplasmic reticulum-localized GDSL lipase gene, which is predominantly transcribed during early anther development. In rms2, a three-nucleotides deletion and one base substitution (TTGT to A) occurred within the GDSL domain, which reduced the lipid hydrolase activity of the resulting protein and led to significant changes in the content of 16 lipid components and numerous other metabolites as revealed by a comparative metabolic analysis. Furthermore, RMS2 is directly targeted by male fertility regulators Undeveloped Tapetum 1 (UDT1) and Persistent Tapetal Cell 1 (PTC1) both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that RMS2 may serve as a key node in the rice male fertility regulatory network. These findings shed light on the function of GDSLs in reproductive development and provide a promising gene resource for hybrid rice breeding.
NA	GDSL esterase/lipases OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 are essential for rice pollen development.	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Biotechnology for Plant Development, School of Life Sciences, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, 510631, China.	Pollen exine contains complex biopolymers of aliphatic lipids and phenolics. Abnormal development of pollen exine often leads to plant sterility. Molecular mechanisms regulating exine formation have been studied extensively but remain ambiguous. Here we report the analyses of three GDSL esterase/lipase protein genes, OsGELP34, OsGELP110, and OsGELP115, for rice exine formation. OsGELP34 was identified by cloning of a male sterile mutant gene. OsGELP34 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum protein and was mainly expressed in anthers during pollen exine formation. osgelp34 mutant displayed abnormal exine and altered expression of a number of key genes required for pollen development. OsGELP110 was previously identified as a gene differentially expressed in meiotic anthers. OsGELP110 was most homologous to OsGELP115, and the two genes showed similar gene expression patterns. Both OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 proteins were localized in peroxisomes. Individual knockout of OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 did not affect the plant fertility, but double knockout of both genes altered the exine structure and rendered the plant male sterile. OsGELP34 is distant from OsGELP110 and OsGELP115 in sequence, and osgelp34 and osgelp110/osgelp115 mutants were different in anther morphology despite both were male sterile. These results suggested that OsGELP34 and OsGELP110/OsGELP115 catalyze different compounds for pollen exine development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
