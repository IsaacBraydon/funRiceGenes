We previously reported the isolation of rgp1, a gene from rice, which encodes a ras-related GTP-binding protein, and subsequently showed that the gene induces specific morphological changes in transgenic tobacco plants. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an rgp1 homologue, rgp2, from rice. The deduced rgp2 protein sequence shows 53% identity with the rice rgp1 protein, but 63% identity with both the marine ray ora3 protein, which is closely associated with synaptic vesicles of neuronal tissue, and the mammalian rab11 protein. Conservation of particular amino acid sequence motifs places rgp2 in the rab/ypt subfamily, which has been implicated in vesicular transport. Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots. In addition, whereas rgp1 shows maximal expression at a particular stage of plantlet growth, rgp2 is constitutively expressed during the same period. Southern blot analysis suggests that, in addition to rgp1 and rgp2, several other homologues exist in rice and these may constitute a small multigene family.
