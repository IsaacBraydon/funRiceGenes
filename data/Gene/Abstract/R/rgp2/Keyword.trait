rgp2	root	Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
rgp2	growth	Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 In addition, whereas rgp1 shows maximal expression at a particular stage of plantlet growth, rgp2 is constitutively expressed during the same period
rgp2	stem	Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
rgp2	panicle	Molecular characterization of rgp2, a gene encoding a small GTP-binding protein from rice	 Northern blot analysis of rgp1 and rgp2 suggests that both genes show relatively high, but differential, levels of expression in leaves, stems and panicles, but low levels in roots
