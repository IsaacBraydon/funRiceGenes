rFKBP75	endosperm	The expression of the large rice FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) demonstrate tissue specificity and heat stress responsiveness	 The only FKBP to be expressed in seeds was the rFKBP75 which was higher in the embryos and endosperm of dry seeds then in the same organs separated from imbibed seeds, indicating that the protein is important in the steps of seed maturation
