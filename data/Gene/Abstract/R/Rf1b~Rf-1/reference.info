g96-152.pdf	A codominant DNA marker closely linked to the rice nuclear restorer gene, RF-1, identified with inter-SSR fingerprinting	1996	Genome	Plant Biotechnology Laboratory, Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals Incorporated, Mobara, Japan.	A new molecular marker (OSRRf) closely linked to the nuclear restorer gene (Rf-1) for fertility in rice has been found. The Rf-1 gene is essential for hybrid rice seed production. A PCR-fingerprinting technique using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) was applied to compare two near-isogenic lines with (MTC-10R) or without (MTC-10A) the Rf-1 gene. Of 76 inter-SSR primers tested, only one primer, (AG)8YC, generated polymorphisms. The tetranucleotide repeats generating polymorphisms were found within each amplicon. the genetic distance between OSRRf and Rf-1 was 3.7 +/- 1.1 cM. As in the case of a codominant marker, this marker will be applied not only to breeding both restorer lines and maintainer lines, but also to the purity management of hybrid rice seeds.
tpc1800676.pdf	Cytoplasmic male sterility of rice with boro II cytoplasm is caused by a cytotoxic peptide and is restored by two related PPR motif genes via distinct modes of mRNA silencing	2006	Plant Cell	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Province, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and nucleus-controlled fertility restoration are widespread plant reproductive features that provide useful tools to exploit heterosis in crops. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this kind of cytoplasmic-nuclear interaction remains unclear. Here, we show in rice (Oryza sativa) with Boro II cytoplasm that an abnormal mitochondrial open reading frame, orf79, is cotranscribed with a duplicated atp6 (B-atp6) gene and encodes a cytotoxic peptide. Expression of orf79 in CMS lines and transgenic rice plants caused gametophytic male sterility. Immunoblot analysis showed that the ORF79 protein accumulates specifically in microspores. Two fertility restorer genes, Rf1a and Rf1b, were identified at the classical locus Rf-1 as members of a multigene cluster that encode pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. RF1A and RF1B are both targeted to mitochondria and can restore male fertility by blocking ORF79 production via endonucleolytic cleavage (RF1A) or degradation (RF1B) of dicistronic B-atp6/orf79 mRNA. In the presence of both restorers, RF1A was epistatic over RF1B in the mRNA processing. We have also shown that RF1A plays an additional role in promoting the editing of atp6 mRNAs, independent of its cleavage function.
