Symbol	Expression
REL2	 In rel2 mutant, the mutation of two nucleotide substitutions in DUF630 domain led to the loss-of-function of REL2 locus and the function of REL2 could be confirmed by complementary expression of REL2 in rel2 mutant
REL2|OsDLT10	 Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsDLT10 was primarily expressed in the stem node, the basic part of axillary bud and leaf sheath, pulvinus |  The hormone treatment investigation indicated that extremely high of exogenous auxin concentrations can inhibit the expression of OsDLT10 |  The expression levels of WUS-like and FON1 were substantially decreased in the Osdlt10 mutants
