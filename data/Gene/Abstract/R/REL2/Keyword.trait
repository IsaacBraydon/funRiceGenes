REL2	leaf	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2
REL2	leaf	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	 The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc
REL2	leaf	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice
REL2	map-based cloning	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	 We firstly mapped REL2 to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy
REL2	auxin	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	 The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc
REL2	leaf shape	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	 The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc
REL2	erect	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2
REL2	plasma membrane	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	 Further studies showed that REL2 protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the REL2 gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice
REL2	leaf rolling	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice
