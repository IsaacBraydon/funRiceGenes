NA	REL2, A Gene Encoding An Unknown Function Protein which Contains DUF630 and DUF632 Domains Controls Leaf Rolling in Rice.	2016	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology in Arid Areas, College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling, 712100, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.	Rice leaves are important energy source for the whole plant. An optimal structure will be beneficial for rice leaves to capture light energy and exchange gas, thus increasing the yield of rice. Moderate leaf rolling and relatively erect plant architecture may contribute to high yield of rice, but the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear.In this study, we identified and characterized a rolling and erect leaf mutant in rice and named it as rel2. Histological analysis showed that the rel2 mutant has increased number of bulliform cells and reduced size of middle bulliform cells. We firstly mapped REL2 to a 35-kb physical region of chromosome 10 by map-based cloning strategy. Further analysis revealed that REL2 encodes a protein containing DUF630 and DUF632 domains. In rel2 mutant, the mutation of two nucleotide substitutions in DUF630 domain led to the loss-of-function of REL2 locus and the function of REL2 could be confirmed by complementary expression of REL2 in rel2 mutant. Further studies showed that REL2 protein is mainly distributed along the plasma membrane of cells and the REL2 gene is relatively higher expressed in younger leaves of rice. The results from quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that REL2 functioning in the leaf shape formation might have functional linkage with many genes associated with the bulliform cells development, auxin synthesis and transport, etc.REL2 is the DUF domains contained protein which involves in the control of leaf rolling in rice. It is the plasma membrane localization and its functions in the control of leaf morphology might involve in multiple biological processes such as bulliform cell development and auxin synthesis and transport.
NA	Rice dwarf and low tillering 10 (OsDLT10) regulates tiller number by monitoring auxin homeostasis	2020	Plant Sci .	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research & State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China; China National Center For Rice Improvement, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, Zhejiang, China.	Tiller number is a crucial agronomic trait that directly affects the number of effective panicles and yield formation in rice. Here, we report a semi-dwarf and low tillering mutant Osdlt10 (dwarf and low tillering 10) that exhibited reduced tiller number, semi-dwarfism, increased grain width, low seed-setting rate, curled leaf tip and a series of abnormalities of agronomic traits. Phenotypic observations showed that Osdlt10 mutants had defects in tiller bud formation and grew slowly at the tillering stage. Map-based cloning revealed that LOC_Os10g41310 was the responsible gene for OsDLT10, which was subsequently demonstrated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and a complementary experiment. Expression pattern analysis indicated that OsDLT10 was primarily expressed in the stem node, the basic part of axillary bud and leaf sheath, pulvinus. The hormone treatment investigation indicated that extremely high of exogenous auxin concentrations can inhibit the expression of OsDLT10. Endogenous auxin content decreased significantly at the base of stem node and axillary bud in Osdlt10 mutants. The results showed that OsDLT10 was related to auxin. qPCR analysis results further showed that the expression levels of auxin transport genes (PINs) and early response genes (IAAs) were significantly increased. The expression levels of WUS-like and FON1 were substantially decreased in the Osdlt10 mutants. These results revealed that OsDLT10 played a critical role in influencing tiller number, likely in association with hormone signals and the WUS-CLV pathway, to regulate axillary bud development in rice.
