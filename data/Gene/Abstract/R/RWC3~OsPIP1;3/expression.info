RWC3|OsPIP1;3	Ectopic expression of a rice plasma membrane intrinsic protein (OsPIP1;3) promotes plant growth and water uptake. |  Expression of GFP-OsPIP1;3 alone in Xenopus oocytes or rice protoplasts showed OsPIP1;3 mislocalization in ER-like neighborhood, whereas co-expression of OsPIP2;2 recruited OsPIP1;3 to the plasma membrane and led to a significant enhancement of water permeability in oocytes |  Further experiment suggested that heterologous expression of OsPIP1;3 in cyanobacterium promoted bacterial growth in the condition with different CO2 gas supply
