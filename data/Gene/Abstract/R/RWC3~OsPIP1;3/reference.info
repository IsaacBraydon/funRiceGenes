cr200734a.pdf	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	2007	Cell Res	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Previous studies have demonstrated the possible role of several aquaporins in seed germination. But systematic investigation of the role of aquaporin family members in this process is lacking. Here, the developmental regulation of plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) expression throughout germination and post-germination processes in rice embryos was analyzed. The expression patterns of the PIPs suggest these aquaporins play different roles in seed germination and seedling growth. Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions. Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination. Our data also revealed that the nitric oxide (NO) donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), promoted seed germination; furthermore, the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, inhibited germination and reduced the stimulative effects of SNP and GSNO on rice germination. Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds. These results suggest that water channels play an important role in seed germination, acting, at least partly, in response to the NO signaling pathway.
Plant Cell Physiol-2004-Lian-481-9.pdf	The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice	2004	Plant Cell Physiol	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, PR China.	Although the discovery of aquaporins in plants has resulted in a paradigm shift in the understanding of plant water relations, the relationship between aquaporins and drought resistance still remains elusive. From an agronomic viewpoint, upland rice is traditionally considered as showing drought avoidance. In the investigation of different morphological and physiological responses of upland rice (Oryza sativa L. spp indica cv. Zhonghan 3) and lowland rice (O. sativa L. spp japonica cv. Xiushui 63) to water deficit, we observed young leaf rolling and the remarkable decline of cumulative transpiration in the upland rice. The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in lowland rice. Protein levels were increased in upland rice and decreased in lowland rice at 10 h after the water deficit. The up-regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance. The physiological significance of this RWC3 up-regulation was then explored with the over-expression of RWC3 in transgenic lowland rice (O. sativa L. spp japonica cv. Zhonghua 11) controlled by a stress-inducible SWPA2 promoter. Compared to the wild-type plant, the transgenic lowland rice exhibited higher root osmotic hydraulic conductivity (Lp), leaf water potential and relative cumulative transpiration at the end of 10 h PEG treatment. These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice.
NA	Aquaporin PIP1;3 of rice and harpin Hpa1 of bacterial blight pathogen cooperate in a type III effector translocation.	2019	J Exp Bot	Department of Plant Pathology, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.	Varieties of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens infect their eukaryotic hosts by deploying the type III translocon to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of eukaryotic cells in which effectors execute their pathological functions. The translocon is hypothetically assembled by bacterial translocators in associations with the assumed receptors situated on eukaryotic plasma membranes. This hypothesis is partially verified in the present study with genetic, biochemical and pathological evidence for the role of a rice aquaporin, plasma membrane intrinsic protein PIP1;3, in the cytosolic import of transcription activator-like effector PthXo1 from the bacterial blight pathogen. PIP1;3 interacts with the bacterial translocator Hpa1 at rice plasma membranes to control PthXo1 translocation from cells of a well-characterized strain of the bacterial blight pathogen into the cytosol of cells of a susceptible rice variety. An extracellular loop sequence of PIP1;3 and the ¦Á-helix motif of Hpa1 determine both the molecular interaction and its consequences with respect to the effector translocation and the bacterial virulence on the susceptible rice variety. Overall, these results provide multiple experimental avenues to support the hypothesis that interactions between bacterial translocators and their interactors at target membrane are essential for bacterial effector translocation.
