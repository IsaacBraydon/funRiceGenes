OsPIP1;1|RWC1	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions
OsPIP1;1|RWC1	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
OsPIP1;2	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
LP2	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice	In addition, LP2 was identified as a functional kinase localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with the drought-responsive aquaporin proteins OsPIP1; 1, OsPIP1; 3, and OsPIP2; 3.
OsPIP2;2	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	Rice aquaporin OsPIP2;2 is a water-transporting facilitator in relevance to drought-tolerant responses	 In concomitant tests of all OsPIPs, four genes (OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, OsPIP2;2, and OsPIP2;4) were induced to express in leaves of rice plants following a physiological drought stress, while OsPIP2;2 was expressed to the highest level
OsPIP2;2	RWC3|OsPIP1;3	Rice aquaporin OsPIP2;2 is a water-transporting facilitator in relevance to drought-tolerant responses	 After de novo expression in tobacco protoplasts, OsPIP2;2 exceeded OsPIP1;3, OsPIP2;1, and OsPIP2;4 to support H2O transport across the plasma membranes
