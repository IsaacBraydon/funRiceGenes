RWC3|OsPIP1;3	ethylene	The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice	 The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in lowland rice
RWC3|OsPIP1;3	seed	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	 Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions| Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination| Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
RWC3|OsPIP1;3	drought	The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice	 The up-regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance| These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice|The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice
RWC3|OsPIP1;3	seed germination	The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination	 Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions| Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination
