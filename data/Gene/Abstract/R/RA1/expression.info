RA1	 Real-time PCR analyses showed that RA1 expression levels were constitutive in most tissues, but most abundant in the leaves and stems |  By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we found that RA1 protein was localized in the chloroplast |  Expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid development related genes were disordered in the ra1 mutant
