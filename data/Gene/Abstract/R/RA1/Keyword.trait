RA1	chloroplast	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 By transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana, we found that RA1 protein was localized in the chloroplast
RA1	chloroplast	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 RNA analysis revealed biogenesis of chloroplast rRNAs was abnormal in ra1
RA1	chloroplast	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 These results suggest that RA1 is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice
RA1	development	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 Expression levels of chlorophyll biosynthesis and plastid development related genes were disordered in the ra1 mutant
RA1	development	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 These results suggest that RA1 is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice
RA1	map-based cloning	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that RA1 gene encodes a glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), which was confirmed by genetic complementation and knockout by Crispr/Cas9 technology
RA1	chloroplast development	Rice albino 1, encoding a glycyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice.	 These results suggest that RA1 is involved in early chloroplast development and establishment of the plastidic ribosome system in rice
