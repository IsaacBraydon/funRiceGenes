Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	abiotic stress	rHsp90 gene expression in response to several environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Further studies showed that rHsp90 mRNA accumulated following exposure to several abiotic stresses, including salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), desiccation (using polyethylene glycol), high pH (8
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	seedling	rHsp90 gene expression in response to several environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) over-expressing rHsp90 exhibited greater tolerance to NaCl, Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) and tobacco seedlings over-expressing rHsp90 could tolerate salt concentrations as high as 200 mM NaCl, whereas untransformed control seedlings couldn't
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	disease resistance	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species
Hsp90|rHsp90|OSGrp94	ethylene	rHsp90 gene expression in response to several environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
