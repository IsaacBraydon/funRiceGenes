New Delhi-110021, India	Rice seedlings exposed to high and low temperatures, salinity and water stress accumulate 87 and 85 kDa stress-associated-proteins (SAP), collectively referred to as SAP 90. In the present study, we provide evidence that SAP 87 of rice is a member of the eukaryotic stress  90 family. Further, high uninduced levels of rice  90 exist in lemma, palea and culm tissues. Dry seeds of rice, wheat, maize and sorghum also contain high uninduced amounts of this protein. Seed-derived callus tissue show high constitutive levels of this protein as well. When seed and callus tissues were subjected to heat shock, the levels of this protein declined. Tissue print-immunoblot analysis using anti SAP 90 antibodies revealed higher accumulation of  90 in the vascular bundles/procambial cells and in the outermost cell layers of various leaves as well as in the meristematic cells of the stem apex. In seeds, this protein was most abundant in the seed coat and whole embryo.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) HSP110 (OsHSP110) is previously shown to be an immunological homologue of yeast HSP104. This protein accumulates in rice seedlings in response to heat shock. However, no such high temperature-induced accumulation of OsHSP110 was found in the topmost leaf of 90-day-old (just prior to flowering) plants of the cultivated species of rice (Oryza sativa L.) in our earlier study. In this paper, we show that, at the comparable growth stage, leaves of O. australiensis accumulated this protein to a marginal extent in response to heat shock, while levels of HSP110 were either markedly declined or remained unaltered in 14 other wild rice species. Further, different organs of the mature cultivated rice plant accumulated differential levels of OsHSP110, constitutively as well as in response to heat shock. In particular, upper portions of culm, grains and developing embryos showed significantly high constitutive levels of OsHSP110. Tissue print immunolocalization studies showed that OsHSP110 is distributed in the vascular bundles in the shoot tissues and in seeds it is specifically localized in the seec coat (outermost layer) only. Importantly, OsHSP110 accumulated in shoots of rice seedlings in response to salinity, desiccation and low temperature stress also; furthermore, salinity stress (NaCl) caused nearly a three-fold higher accumulation of this protein than high temperature stress.
1-s2.0-S0981942806000866-main.pdf	rHsp90 gene expression in response to several environmental stresses in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2006	Plant Physiol Biochem	Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Stress Molecular Biology Laboratory, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, PR China.	In this study, the gene for a rice (Oryza sativa L.) 90 kDa heat shock protein (rHsp90, GenBank accession no. AB037681) was identified by screening rice root cDNAs that were up-regulated under carbonate (NaHCO(3)) stress using the method of differential display, and cloned. The open-reading-frame of rHsp90-cDNA was predicted to encode a protein containing 810 amino acids, which showed high similarity to proteins in Hordeum vulgare (accession no. X67960) and Catharathus roseus (accession no. L14594). Further studies showed that rHsp90 mRNA accumulated following exposure to several abiotic stresses, including salts (NaCl, NaHCO(3) and Na(2)CO(3)), desiccation (using polyethylene glycol), high pH (8.0 and 11.0) and high temperature (42 and 50 degrees C). Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) over-expressing rHsp90 exhibited greater tolerance to NaCl, Na(2)CO(3) and NaHCO(3) and tobacco seedlings over-expressing rHsp90 could tolerate salt concentrations as high as 200 mM NaCl, whereas untransformed control seedlings couldn't. These results suggest that rHsp90 plays an important role in multiple environmental stresses.
1-s2.0-S1931312810000715-main.pdf	The Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex facilitates the maturation and transport of a PAMP receptor in rice innate immunity	2010	Cell Host Microbe	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Takayama, Ikoma, Japan.	Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) represents a critical first step of innate defense in plants and animals. However, maturation and transport of PRRs are not well understood. We find that the rice chitin receptor OsCERK1 interacts with Hsp90 and its cochaperone Hop/Sti1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Hop/Sti1 and Hsp90 are required for efficient transport of OsCERK1 from the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) via a pathway dependent on Sar1, a small GTPase which regulates ER-to-Golgi trafficking. Further, Hop/Sti1 and Hsp90 are present at the PM in a complex (designated the "defensome") with OsRac1, a plant-specific Rho-type GTPase. Finally, Hop/Sti1 was required for chitin-triggered immunity and resistance to rice blast fungus. Our results suggest that the Hop/Sti1-Hsp90 chaperone complex plays an important and likely conserved role in the maturation and transport of PRRs and may function to link PRRs and Rac/Rop GTPases.
10.1007-BF02936129.pdf	Plant Hsp90 family with special reference to rice	1998	Journal of Biosciences	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Delhi South Campus, Benito Juarez Road, Dhaula Kuan, 110 021, New Delhi, India	Hsp90 family represents a group of highly conserved and strongly expressed proteins present in almost all biological species. Heat shock proteins in the range of 90 kDa have been detected in a range of plant species andhsp90 genes have been cloned and characterized in selected instances. However, the expression characteristics of plant Hsp90 are poorly understood. Work on expression characteristics of rice Hsp90 is reviewed in this paper. Experimental evidence is provided for indicating that while the rice 87 kDa protein is transiently synthesized within initial 2 h of heat shock, high steady-state levels of this protein are retained even under prolonged high temperature stress conditions or recovery following 4 h heat shock. It is further shown that fifteen different wild rices accumulate differential levels of these proteins in response to heat shock treatment.
tpc1904035.pdf	RAR1 and HSP90 form a complex with Rac/Rop GTPase and function in innate-immune responses in rice	2007	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma 630-0101, Japan.	A rice (Oryza sativa) Rac/Rop GTPase, Os Rac1, is involved in innate immunity, but its molecular function is largely unknown. RAR1 (for required for Mla12 resistance) and HSP90 (a heat shock protein 90 kD) are important components of R gene-mediated disease resistance, and their function is conserved in several plant species. HSP90 has also recently been shown to be important in mammalian innate immunity. However, their functions at the molecular level are not well understood. In this study, we examined the functional relationships between Os Rac1, RAR1, and HSP90. Os RAR1-RNA interference (RNAi) rice plants had impaired basal resistance to a compatible race of the blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and the virulent bacterial blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae. Constitutively active Os Rac1 complemented the loss of resistance, suggesting that Os Rac1 and RAR1 are functionally linked. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments with rice cell culture extracts indicate that Rac1 forms a complex with RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 in vivo. Studies with Os RAR1-RNAi and treatment with geldanamycin, an HSP90-specific inhibitor, showed that RAR1 and HSP90 are essential for the Rac1-mediated enhancement of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immune responses in rice cell cultures. Furthermore, the function of HSP90, but not RAR1, may be essential for their association with the Rac1 complex. Os Rac1 also regulates RAR1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Together, our results indicate that Rac1, RAR1, HSP90, and HSP70 form one or more protein complexes in rice cells and suggest that these proteins play important roles in innate immunity in rice.
