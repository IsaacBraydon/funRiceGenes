Root outer cell layers of Oryza sativa (rice), which comprise the epidermis, exodermis and sclerenchyma, play an important role in protecting the roots from various stresses in soil, but the molecular mechanisms for the specification of these cell layers are poorly understood. In this work, we report on defective in outer cell layer specification 1 (Docs1), which is involved in the specification of outer cell layers in rice roots. Docs1 was isolated by map-based cloning using a mutant (c68) defective in the outer cell layers of primary roots. It encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR RLK). Docs1 mRNA was expressed in all tissues including roots, leaf blades and sheaths, and flowers. Immunostaining with an anti-Docs1 antibody showed that Docs1 was localized at the epidermis and exodermis, depending on the root region. Furthermore, Docs1 showed polar localization at the distal side. Subcellular examination showed that Docs1 was localized to the plasma membrane. Comparison of genome-wide transcriptional profiles between the wild-type and the knock-out mutant roots using microarray analysis showed that 61 and 41 genes were up- and downregulated in the mutant, including genes encoding putative transcription factors and genes potentially involved in cell wall metabolism. These results suggest that Docs1 might directly or indirectly regulate multiple genes involved in the proper development of root outer cell layers in rice.
NA	Root cone angle is enlarged in docs1 LRR-RLK mutants in rice.	2017	Rice (N Y)	CIRAD, UMR AGAP, F34398, Montpellier, France.	The DEFECTIVE IN OUTER CELL LAYER SPECIFICATION 1 (DOCS1) gene belongs to the Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) subfamily. It has been discovered few years ago in Oryza sativa (rice) in a screen to isolate mutants with defects in sensitivity to aluminum. The c68 (docs1-1) mutant possessed a nonsense mutation in the C-terminal part of the DOCS1 kinase domain.We have generated a new loss-of-function mutation in the DOCS1 gene (docs1-2) using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. This new loss-of-function mutant and docs1-1 present similar phenotypes suggesting the original docs1-1 was a null allele. Besides the aluminum sensitivity phenotype, both docs1 mutants shared also several root phenotypes described previously: less root hairs and mixed identities of the outer cell layers. Moreover, our new results suggest that DOCS1 could also play a role in root cap development. We hypothesized these docs1 root phenotypes may affect gravity responses. As expected, in seedlings, the early gravitropic response was delayed. Furthermore, at adult stage, the root gravitropic set angle of docs1 mutants was also affected since docs1 mutant plants displayed larger root cone angles.All these observations add new insights into the DOCS1 gene function in gravitropic responses at several stages of plant development.
