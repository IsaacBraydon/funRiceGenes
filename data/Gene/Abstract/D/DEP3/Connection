DEP3	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	 Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3
DEP3	GW2|OsGW2	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	 Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3
DEP3	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	GR5 acts in the G protein pathway to regulate grain size in rice.	 Four downstream target genes of GR5 in grain development (DEP2, DEP3, DRW1, and CyCD5;2) were revealed and their core T/CGCAC motif identified by yeast one-hybrid, EMSA, and ChIP-PCR experiments
