DHD1	Ehd1	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 Both DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D affect heading date by regulating expression of Ehd1
DHD1	Ehd1	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 We propose that DHD1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D to delay heading date by inhibiting expression of Ehd1
