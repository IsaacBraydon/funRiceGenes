DHD1	yield	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 Here, we report a GRAS protein DHD1 (Delayed Heading Date1) delays heading and enhances yield in rice
DHD1	nucleus	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D located in the nucleus and showed that rhythmic expression
DHD1	heading date	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 Here, we report a GRAS protein DHD1 (Delayed Heading Date1) delays heading and enhances yield in rice
DHD1	heading date	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 Both DHD1 and OsHAP5C/D affect heading date by regulating expression of Ehd1
DHD1	heading date	DELAYED HEADING DATE1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D, delays flowering time and enhances yield in rice.	 We propose that DHD1 interacts with OsHAP5C/D to delay heading date by inhibiting expression of Ehd1
