DGP1	transcription factor	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis
DGP1	photosynthesis	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Importantly, we found that DGP1 interacts with the rice proteins GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (OsGLK1) and GOLDEN2-LIKE2 (OsGLK2), the two transcription factors involved in the regulation of photosynthesis
DGP1	photosynthesis	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 Our results demonstrate that DGP1 is a repressor of OsGLK activity and thus photosynthesis in rice
DGP1	chlorophyll content	DEEP GREEN PANICLE1 suppresses GOLDEN2-LIKE activity to reduce chlorophyll synthesis in rice glumes.	 We identified the dgp1 mutant, which has increased chlorophyll content in glumes
