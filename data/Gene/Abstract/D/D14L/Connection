D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth
D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation
D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
D14L	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 We demonstrate that D14L recognizes the karrikin signal and recruits the SCFD3 ubiquitin ligase for the ubiquitination and degradation of OsSMAX1, mirroring the SL-induced and D14- and D3-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of D53
D14L	OsSMAX1	Karrikin Signaling Acts Parallel to and Additively with Strigolactone Signaling to Regulate Rice Mesocotyl Elongation in Darkness 	 Overexpression of OsSMAX1 promoted mesocotyl elongation in the dark, whereas knockout of OsSMAX1 suppressed the elongated-mesocotyl phenotypes of d14l and d3 but had little effect on their shoot branching phenotype
D14L	OsZAS	Zaxinone synthase controls arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization level in rice.	 Moreover, exogenous treatment with the synthetic SL analog GR24 rescued the zas mutant mycorrhizal phenotype, indicating that the lower AM colonization rate of zas is caused by a deficiency in SLs at the early stages of the interaction, and indicating that during this phase OsZAS activity is required to induce SL production, possibly mediated by the Dwarf14-Like (D14L) signaling pathway
