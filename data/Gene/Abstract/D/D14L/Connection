D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	 In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth
D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	 This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation
D14L	HTD2|D88|D14	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	 Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
