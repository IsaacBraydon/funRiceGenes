NA	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	2015	J Genet Genomics	Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that control plant development in response to environmental conditions. In rice, mesocotyl elongation is regulated by SLs in the dark, while mesocotyls are longer in SL deficient or insensitive mutants. SLs are perceived by DWARF14 (D14), which is a member of a small gene family. In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth. The mesocotyls of D14L RNAi lines are longer than those of WT in the dark. This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation. This phenotype is alleviated by the exogenous supply of GR24, a synthetic SL, suggesting that D14L is not necessary for SL signaling. D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia. Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively.
NA	Independent signalling cues underpin arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and large lateral root induction in rice.	2017	New Phytol	Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge, Downing Street, Cambridge, CB2 3EA, UK.	Perception of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) triggers distinct plant signalling responses for parallel establishment of symbiosis and induction of lateral root formation. Rice receptor kinase CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) and ¦Á/¦Â-fold hydrolase DWARF14-LIKE (D14L) are involved in pre-symbiotic fungal perception. After 6<U+00A0>wk post-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis, root developmental responses, fungal colonization and transcriptional responses were monitored in two independent cerk1 null mutants; a deletion mutant lacking D14L, and with D14L complemented as well as their respective wild-type cultivars (cv Nipponbare and Nihonmasari). Here we show that although essential for symbiosis, D14L is dispensable for AMF-induced root architectural modulation, which conversely relies on CERK1. Our results demonstrate uncoupling of symbiosis and the symbiotic root developmental signalling during pre-symbiosis with CERK1 required for AMF-induced root architectural changes.
