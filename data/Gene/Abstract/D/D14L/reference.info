NA	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	2015	J Genet Genomics	Department of Agricultural and Environmental Biology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Strigolactones (SLs) are a class of plant hormones that control plant development in response to environmental conditions. In rice, mesocotyl elongation is regulated by SLs in the dark, while mesocotyls are longer in SL deficient or insensitive mutants. SLs are perceived by DWARF14 (D14), which is a member of a small gene family. In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth. The mesocotyls of D14L RNAi lines are longer than those of WT in the dark. This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation. This phenotype is alleviated by the exogenous supply of GR24, a synthetic SL, suggesting that D14L is not necessary for SL signaling. D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia. Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively.
