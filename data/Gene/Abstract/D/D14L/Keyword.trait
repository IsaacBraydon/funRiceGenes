D14L	vascular bundle	Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.	D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia

D14L	root	Independent signalling cues underpin arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and large lateral root induction in rice.	 After 6<U+00A0>wk post-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis, root developmental responses, fungal colonization and transcriptional responses were monitored in two independent cerk1 null mutants; a deletion mutant lacking D14L, and with D14L complemented as well as their respective wild-type cultivars (cv Nipponbare and Nihonmasari)
D14L	root	Independent signalling cues underpin arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and large lateral root induction in rice.	 Here we show that although essential for symbiosis, D14L is dispensable for AMF-induced root architectural modulation, which conversely relies on CERK1
