Du1	Wx|qFC6	Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of Wxb pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Du1 specifically affects the splicing efficiency of Wx(b) and regulates starch biosynthesis by mediating the expression of starch biosynthesis genes
Du1	Wx|qFC6	Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of Wxb pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	Analysis of du1wx shows that Du1 acts upstream of Wx(b)
Du1	Wx|qFC6	Du1, encoding a novel Prp1 protein, regulates starch biosynthesis through affecting the splicing of Wxb pre-mRNAs in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	These results strongly suggest that Du1 may function as a regulator of the starch biosynthesis by affecting the splicing of Wx(b) and the expression of other genes involved in the rice starch biosynthetic pathways
