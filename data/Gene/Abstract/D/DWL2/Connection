DWL2	DWT1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Furthermore, we showed that DWL2, the homolog of DWT1, is also able to interact with OsPIP5K1 and shares partial functional redundancy with DWT1 in controlling rice uniformity
DWL2	DWT1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway
