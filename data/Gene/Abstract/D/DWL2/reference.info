NA	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 20040, China.	Uniform growth of the main shoot and tillers significantly influences rice plant architecture and grain yield. The WUSCHEL-related homeobox transcription factor DWT1 is a key regulator of this important agronomic trait, disruption of which causes enhanced main shoot dominance and tiller dwarfism by an unknown mechanism. Here, we have used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify OsPIP5K1, a member of the rice phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase family, as a protein that interacts with DWT1. Cytological analyses confirmed that DWT1 induces accumulation of OsPIP5K1 and its product PI(4,5)P2 , a phosphoinositide secondary messenger, in nuclear bodies. Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance. Conversely, overexpression of OsPIP5K1 partially rescues dwt1 developmental defects. Furthermore, we showed that DWL2, the homolog of DWT1, is also able to interact with OsPIP5K1 and shares partial functional redundancy with DWT1 in controlling rice uniformity. Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway.
