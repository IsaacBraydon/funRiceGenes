DWL2	growth	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway
