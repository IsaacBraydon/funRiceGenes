DSM1	panicle	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages
DSM1	oxidative	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	" Peroxidase activity, electrolyte leakage, chlorophyll content, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine staining revealed that the dsm1 mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress due to an increase in ROS damage caused by the reduced POX activity"
DSM1	seedling	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages
DSM1	seedling	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 Overexpression of DSM1 in rice increased the tolerance to dehydration stress at the seedling stage
DSM1	drought resistance	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice
DSM1	salt	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	" By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold"
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	" We identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant (drought-hypersensitive mutant1 [dsm1]) of a putative MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) gene in rice (Oryza sativa)
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 Two allelic dsm1 mutants were more sensitive than wild-type plants to drought stress at both seedling and panicle development stages
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 The dsm1 mutants lost water more rapidly than wild-type plants under drought stress, which was in agreement with the increased drought-sensitivity phenotype of the mutant plants
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 DSM1-RNA interference lines were also hypersensitive to drought stress
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 By real-time PCR analysis, the DSM1 gene was induced by salt, drought, and abscisic acid, but not by cold
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	 Together, these results suggest that DSM1 might be a novel MAPKKK functioning as an early signaling component in regulating responses to drought stress by regulating scavenging of ROS in rice
DSM1	drought	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice	A Raf-like MAPKKK gene DSM1 mediates drought resistance through reactive oxygen species scavenging in rice"
