DHT1	HTD2|D88|D14	Dwarf and High Tillering1 represses rice tillering through mediating the splicing of D14 pre-mRNA.	 We show that DHT1 encodes a monocotyledon-specific hnRNP-like protein that acts as a previously unrecognized intron splicing factor for many precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs), including for the SL receptor gene D14
DHT1	HTD2|D88|D14	Dwarf and High Tillering1 represses rice tillering through mediating the splicing of D14 pre-mRNA.	 We find that the dht1 (DHT1I232F) mutant protein is impaired in its stability and RNA binding activity, causing defective splicing of D14 pre-mRNA and reduced D14 expression, and consequently leading to the SL signaling-defective phenotypes
