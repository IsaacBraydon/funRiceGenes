DRUS1|FLR1	DRUS2|FLR2	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 We found that FLR1, FLR2 and FLR8 negatively regulated grain size, and FLR15 positively regulated grain size
DRUS1|FLR1	OsRac1	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 A mechanism underlying the regulation of grain size by FLR1 is that FLR1 is associated with OsRac1 Rho-like GTPase, a positive regulator of grain size
