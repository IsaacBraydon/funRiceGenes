DRUS1	 In the later stages of anther development, survival of the endothecium requires DRUS1/2, which may stimulate expression of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase gene UGP2 and starch biosynthesis in pollen
DRUS1|FLR1	 In the present study, we found that FERONIA-like receptor 1 (FLR1) positively regulates Magnaporthe oryzae resistance and that expression of FLR1 is strongly induced in response to Ca(2+) deficiency |  Changes in expression of overlapping genes between the flr1 mutant and in plants under low-Ca(2+) treatment were consistent in terms of direction, indicating that FLR1 is involved in Ca(2+) homeostasis
