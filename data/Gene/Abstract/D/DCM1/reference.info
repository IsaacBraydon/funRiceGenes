Meiotic cytokinesis influences the fertility and ploidy of gametes. However, limited information is available on the genetic control of meiotic cytokinesis in plants. Here, we identified a rice mutant with low male fertility, defective callose in meiosis 1 (dcm1). The pollen grains of dcm1 are proved to be defective in exine formation. Meiotic cytokinesis is disrupted in dcm1, resulting in disordered spindle orientation during meiosis II and formation of pollen grains with varied size and DNA content. We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in dcm1 is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates. Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the dcm1 pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene. The DCM1 protein contains five tandem CCCH motifs and interacts with nuclear poly (A) binding proteins (PABNs) in nuclear speckles. The expression profiles of genes related to callose synthesis and degradation are significantly modified in dcm1. Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice.
