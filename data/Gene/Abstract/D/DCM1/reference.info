NA	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	2018	PLoS Genet	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Meiotic cytokinesis influences the fertility and ploidy of gametes. However, limited information is available on the genetic control of meiotic cytokinesis in plants. Here, we identified a rice mutant with low male fertility, defective callose in meiosis 1 (dcm1). The pollen grains of dcm1 are proved to be defective in exine formation. Meiotic cytokinesis is disrupted in dcm1, resulting in disordered spindle orientation during meiosis II and formation of pollen grains with varied size and DNA content. We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in dcm1 is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates. Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the dcm1 pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene. The DCM1 protein contains five tandem CCCH motifs and interacts with nuclear poly (A) binding proteins (PABNs) in nuclear speckles. The expression profiles of genes related to callose synthesis and degradation are significantly modified in dcm1. Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice.
NA	A novel CCCH-type zinc-finger protein SAW1 activates OsGA20ox3 to regulate gibberellin homeostasis and anther development in rice.	2020	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Male sterility is a prerequisite for hybrid seed production. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) are involved in regulating the male reproductive development, but the mechanism underlying GA homeostasis in anther development remains less understood. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new positive regulator of GA homeostasis, Swollen Anther Wall 1 (SAW1), for anther development in rice (Oryza sativa). Rice plants carrying the recessive mutant allele saw1 produces abnormal anthers with a swollen anther wall and aborted pollen. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SAW1 in rice generated similar male sterile plants. SAW1 encodes a novel nucleus-localizing CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, and this protein could directly bind to the promoter region of the GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox3 to induce its anther-specific expression. In the saw1 anther, the significantly decreased OsGA20ox3 expression resulted in lower bioactive GA content, which in turn caused the lower expression of the GA-inducible anther-regulator gene OsGAMYB. Thus, our results disclose the mechanism of the SAW1-GA20ox3-GAMYB pathway in controlling rice anther development, and provide a new target gene for the rapid generation of male sterile lines by genome editing for hybrid breeding.
