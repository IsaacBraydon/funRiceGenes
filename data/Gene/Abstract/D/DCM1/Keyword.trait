DCM1	pollen	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	 The pollen grains of dcm1 are proved to be defective in exine formation
DCM1	pollen	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	 Furthermore, peripheral callose surrounding the dcm1 pollen mother cells (PMCs) also disappeared untimely around pachytene
DCM1	zinc	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.
DCM1	R protein	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.
DCM1	meiotic	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.
DCM1	meiotic	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	 We demonstrated that meiotic cytokinesis defect in dcm1 is caused by prematurely dissolution of callosic plates
DCM1	meiotic	The zinc finger protein DCM1 is required for male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose in rice.	 Together, we propose that DCM1 plays an essential role in male meiotic cytokinesis by preserving callose from prematurely dissolution in rice
