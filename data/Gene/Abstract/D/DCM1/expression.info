DCM1	 The expression profiles of genes related to callose synthesis and degradation are significantly modified in dcm1
DCM1|SAW1	 SAW1 encodes a novel nucleus-localizing CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, and this protein could directly bind to the promoter region of the GA synthesis gene OsGA20ox3 to induce its anther-specific expression |  In the saw1 anther, the significantly decreased OsGA20ox3 expression resulted in lower bioactive GA content, which in turn caused the lower expression of the GA-inducible anther-regulator gene OsGAMYB
