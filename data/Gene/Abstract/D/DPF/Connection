CYP99A2	DPF	Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.	In addition, DPF partly regulates CYP99A2 through the N-box
DPF	OsCPS2|OsCyc2	Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice	Furthermore, DPF activated the promoters of COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 (CPS2) and CYTOCHROME P450 MONOOXIGENASE (CYP) 99A2, which are implicated in the biosynthesis of PCs and MLs, respectively.
