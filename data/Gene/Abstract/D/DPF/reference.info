NA	Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.	2015	Plant J	Disease Resistant Crops Research Unit, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, 305-8602, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces diterpenoid phytoalexins (DPs), momilactones (MLs) and phytocassanes (PCs) as major phytoalexins. Accumulation of DPs is induced in rice by blast fungus infection, copper chloride or ultraviolet light. Herein, we report a rice transcription factor (TF) - named DITERPENOID PHYTOALEXIN FACTOR (DPF), a basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF. DPF is expressed mainly in roots and panicles, and is inducible in leaves by blast infection, copper chloride, or UV. Expressions of all DP biosynthetic genes and accumulation of MLs and PCs were remarkably increased and decreased in DPF overexpressing and DPF-knockdown rice, respectively. These results clearly demonstrated that DPF positively regulates DP accumulation via transcriptional regulation of DP biosynthetic genes, and plays a central role in the biosynthesis of DPs in rice. Furthermore, DPF activated the promoters of COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE2 (CPS2) and CYTOCHROME P450 MONOOXIGENASE (CYP) 99A2, which are implicated in the biosynthesis of PCs and MLs, respectively. Mutations in the N-boxes in the CPS2 upstream region, to which several animal bHLH TFs bind, remarkably decreased CPS2 transcription, indicating that DPF positively regulates CPS2 transcription through the N-boxes. In addition, DPF partly regulates CYP99A2 through the N-box. This study demonstrated that DPF acts as a master TF in DP biosynthesis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
