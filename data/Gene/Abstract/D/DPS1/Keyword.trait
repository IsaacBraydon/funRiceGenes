DPS1	pollen	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 dps1 plants were characterized by small whitish anthers with altered cuticle morphology and absence of pollen grains
DPS1	panicle	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 These results suggest that DPS1 plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation and panicle development in rice
DPS1	anther	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 These results suggest that DPS1 plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation and panicle development in rice
DPS1	development	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 These results suggest that DPS1 plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation and panicle development in rice
DPS1	map-based cloning	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that DPS1 encodes a mitochondrial-localized protein containing a cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS) domain which showed the highest expression in panicles and anthers
DPS1	cell death	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Panicles of dps1 plants showed an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower antioxidant activity and increased programmed cell death
DPS1	homeostasis	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Global gene expression analysis in dps1 revealed that biological processes related to fatty acid metabolism and ROS homeostasis were significantly affected and the expression of key genes involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis were downregulated
DPS1	cuticle	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 dps1 plants were characterized by small whitish anthers with altered cuticle morphology and absence of pollen grains
DPS1	cuticle	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 These results suggest that DPS1 plays a vital role in regulating ROS homeostasis, anther cuticle formation and panicle development in rice
DPS1	cutin	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Amounts of cuticular wax and cutin were significantly reduced in dps1 anthers
DPS1	cutin	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Global gene expression analysis in dps1 revealed that biological processes related to fatty acid metabolism and ROS homeostasis were significantly affected and the expression of key genes involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis were downregulated
DPS1	reactive oxygen species	Degenerated panicle and partial sterility 1 (DPS1) encodes a CBS domain containing protein required for anther cuticle and panicle development in rice.	 Panicles of dps1 plants showed an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower antioxidant activity and increased programmed cell death
