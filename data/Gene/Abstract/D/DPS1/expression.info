DPS1	 Map-based cloning revealed that DPS1 encodes a mitochondrial-localized protein containing a cystathionine Î²-synthase (CBS) domain which showed the highest expression in panicles and anthers |  Global gene expression analysis in dps1 revealed that biological processes related to fatty acid metabolism and ROS homeostasis were significantly affected and the expression of key genes involved in wax and cutin biosynthesis were downregulated
