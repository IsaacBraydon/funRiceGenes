DGL1|OsKTN60	dwarf	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	 Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR| In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions
DGL1|OsKTN60	 ga 	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	 Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR| GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced| The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant| Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization
DGL1|OsKTN60	growth	Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa	 We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
DGL1|OsKTN60	root	Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa	 We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
DGL1|OsKTN60	cell elongation	Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa	 We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
DGL1|OsKTN60	gibberellin	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	 These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling
DGL1|OsKTN60	 BR 	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	 GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced
DGL1|OsKTN60	leaf	Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling	 Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR
