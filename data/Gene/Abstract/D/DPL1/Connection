DPL1	DPL2	Rice pollen hybrid incompatibility caused by reciprocal gene loss of duplicated genes	 We detected only one reproducible interaction, and identified paralogous hybrid incompatibility genes, DOPPELGANGER1 (DPL1) and DOPPELGANGER2 (DPL2), by positional cloning
DPL1	DPL2	Rice pollen hybrid incompatibility caused by reciprocal gene loss of duplicated genes	 Independent disruptions of DPL1 and DPL2 occurred in indica and japonica, respectively
