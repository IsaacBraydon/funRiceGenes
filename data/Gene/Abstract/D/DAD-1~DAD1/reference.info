Tanaka-1997-dad-1, A putative pr.pdf	dad-1, A putative programmed cell death suppressor gene in rice	1997	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Plant Pathology & Genetic Engineering, College of Agriculture, Okayama University, Japan.	The human dad-1 cDNA homolog was isolated from rice plants. The amino acid sequence of the predicted protein product is well conserved in both animals and plants. This rice dad-1 homolog can rescue the temperature-sensitive dad-1 mutants of hamster cells from apoptotic death, suggesting that the rice dad-1 homolog also functions as a suppressor for programmed cell death.
