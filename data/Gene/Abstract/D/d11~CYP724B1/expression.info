D11|CPB1|CYP724B1	 Overexpression of CPB1/D11 under the background of cpb1 mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls |  These results demonstrated that the specific mutation in CPB1/D11 influenced development of panicle architecture and seed size, and manipulation of CPB1/D11 expression using the panicle-specific promoter could be used to increase seed size, leading to grain yield improvement in rice	 Overexpression of CPB1/D11 under the background of cpb1 mutant not only rescued normal panicle architecture and plant height, but also had a larger leaf angle and seed size than the controls
D11|CPB1|CYP724B1|GNS4	 A single nucleotide polymorphism (deletion) in the promoter region of GNS4 reduced its expression level in the mutant, leading to reduced grain number and smaller grains |  Overexpression of GNS4 significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds	 Overexpression of GNS4 significantly increased organ size, 1000-grain weight, and panicle size, and subsequently enhanced grain yields in both the Nipponbare and Wuyunjing7 (a high-yielding cultivar) backgrounds
D11|CPB1|CYP724B1|GNS4|PMM1	 Furthermore, overexpression of OsDWARF4 (D4), another gene encoding cytochrome P450, completely rescued the abnormal panicle phenotype of pmm1-1 |  Overexpression of D4 could successfully rescue the abnormal panicle architecture of pmm1 plants, indicating that PMM1/D11 and D4 function redundantly in BRs biosynthesis	 Furthermore, overexpression of OsDWARF4 (D4), another gene encoding cytochrome P450, completely rescued the abnormal panicle phenotype of pmm1-1 |  Overexpression of D4 could successfully rescue the abnormal panicle architecture of pmm1 plants, indicating that PMM1/D11 and D4 function redundantly in BRs biosynthesis
