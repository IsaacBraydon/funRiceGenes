DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	domestication	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	flower	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	reproductive	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	floral	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	heading date	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	breeding	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	 Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding
