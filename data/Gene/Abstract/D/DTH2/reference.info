PNAS-2013-Wu-1213962110.pdf	Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Flowering time (i.e., heading date in crops) is an important ecological trait that determines growing seasons and regional adaptability of plants to specific natural environments. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a short-day plant that originated in the tropics. Increasing evidence suggests that the northward expansion of cultivated rice was accompanied by human selection of the heading date under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. We report here the molecular cloning and characterization of DTH2 (for Days to heading on chromosome 2), a minor-effect quantitative trait locus that promotes heading under LD conditions. We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1. Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia. Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding.
NA	CONSTANS-Like 9 (OsCOL9) Interacts with Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1(OsRACK1) to Regulate Blast Resistance through Salicylic Acid and Ethylene Signaling Pathways.	2016	PLoS One	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	In a previous transcriptome analysis of early response genes in rice during Magnaporthe oryzae infection, we identified a CONSTANS-like (COL) gene OsCOL9. In the present study, we investigated the functional roles of OsCOL9 in blast resistance. OsCOL9 belonged to group II of the COL protein family, and it contained a BB-box and a C-terminal CCT (CONSTANS, COL and TOC1) domain. OsCOL9 was found in the nucleus of rice cells, and it exerted transcriptional activation activities through its middle region (MR). Magnaporthe oryzae infection induced OsCOL9 expression, and transgenic OsCOL9 knock-out rice plants showed increased pathogen susceptibility. OsCOL9 was a critical regulator of pathogen-related genes, especially PR1b, which were also activated by exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylicacid (ACC), the precursor of ethylene (ET). Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis. Interestingly, we found that OsCOL9 physically interacted with the scaffold protein OsRACK1 through its CCT domain, and the OsRACK1 expression was induced in response to exogenous SA and ACC as well as M. oryzae infection. Taken together, these results indicated that the COL protein OsCOL9 interacted with OsRACK1, and it enhanced the rice blast resistance through SA and ET signaling pathways.
NA	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	2016	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Flowering or heading is one of most important agronomic traits in rice. It has been characterized that CONSTANS (CO) and CONSTANS-like (COL) proteins are critical flowering regulators in response to photoperiodic stress in plants. We have previously identified that the COL family member OsCOL9 can positively enhance the rice blast resistance. In the present study, we aimed to explore the functional role of OsCOL9 in modulating the photoperiodic flowering. Our data showed that overexpression of OsCOL9 delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level. OsCOL9 expression exhibited two types of circadian patterns under different daylight conditions, and it could delay the heading date by suppressing the Ehd1 photoperiodic flowering pathway. In contrast, the expressions of previously reported flowering regulators were not significantly changed in OsCOL9 transgenic plants, indicating that OsCOL9 functioned independently of other flowering pathways. In addition, OsCOL9 served as a potential yield gene, and its deficiency reduced the grain number of main panicle in plants. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that OsCOL9 physically interacted with Receptor for Activated C-kinase 1 (OsRACK1). Rhythmic pattern analysis suggested that OsRACK1 responded to the change of daylight, which was regulated by the circadian clock. Taken together, our results revealed that OsCOL9 could delay the flowering time in rice by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.
NA	Double Mutation of Days to Heading 2 and CONSTANS 3 Improves Agronomic Performance of Japonica Rice under Short Daylight Conditions in Southern China.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	Guangdong Laboratory for Lingnan Modern Agriculture, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Some progress has been made in understanding the pathways related to rice heading, but their applications to breeding japonica rice varieties adapted to grow in low-latitude areas (&quot;indica to japonica&quot;) are limited. We edited eight adaptation-related genes via a lab-established CRISPR/Cas9 system in a japonica variety, Shennong265 (SN265). All T(0) plants and their progeny bearing random mutation permutations were planted in southern China and screened for changes in heading date. We found that the double mutant of Days to heading 2 (DTH2) and CONSTANS 3 (OsCO3) (dth2-osco3), two CONSTANS-like (COL) genes, showed significantly delayed heading under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions in Guangzhou and manifested great yield increase under SD conditions. We further demonstrated that the heading-related Hd3a-OsMADS14 pathway was down-regulated in the dth2-osco3 mutant lines. The editing of the COL genes DTH2 and OsCO3 greatly improves the agronomic performance of japonica rice in Southern China.
