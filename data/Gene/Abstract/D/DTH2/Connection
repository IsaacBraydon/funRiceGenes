DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	OsACO1	CONSTANS-Like 9 (OsCOL9) Interacts with Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1(OsRACK1) to Regulate Blast Resistance through Salicylic Acid and Ethylene Signaling Pathways.	Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis

Further analysis indicated that OsCOL9 over-expression increased the expressions of phytohormone biosynthetic genes, NPR1, WRKY45, OsACO1 and OsACS1, which were related to SA and ET biosynthesis
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	Ehd1	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	Our data showed that overexpression of OsCOL9 delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	Ehd1	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	OsCOL9 expression exhibited two types of circadian patterns under different daylight conditions, and it could delay the heading date by suppressing the Ehd1 photoperiodic flowering pathway
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	Ehd1	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	Taken together, our results revealed that OsCOL9 could delay the flowering time in rice by repressing the Ehd1 pathway
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	Hd3a	CONSTANS-like 9 (COL9) delays the flowering time in Oryza sativa by repressing the Ehd1 pathway.	Our data showed that overexpression of OsCOL9 delayed the flowering time under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions, leading to suppressed expressions of EHd1, RFT and Hd3a at the mRNA Level
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	OsCO3	Double Mutation of Days to Heading 2 and CONSTANS 3 Improves Agronomic Performance of Japonica Rice under Short Daylight Conditions in Southern China.	 We found that the double mutant of Days to heading 2 (DTH2) and CONSTANS 3 (OsCO3) (dth2-osco3), two CONSTANS-like (COL) genes, showed significantly delayed heading under both short-day (SD) and long-day (LD) conditions in Guangzhou and manifested great yield increase under SD conditions
DTH2|OsCOL9|OsCCT08	OsCO3	Double Mutation of Days to Heading 2 and CONSTANS 3 Improves Agronomic Performance of Japonica Rice under Short Daylight Conditions in Southern China.	 The editing of the COL genes DTH2 and OsCO3 greatly improves the agronomic performance of japonica rice in Southern China
