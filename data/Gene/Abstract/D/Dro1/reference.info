Using the 'basket' method, the ratio of deep rooting (RDR; the proportion of total roots that elongated through the basket bottom) was calculated to evaluate deep rooting. A new major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling RDR was detected on chromosome 9 by using 117 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between the lowland cultivar IR64, with shallow rooting, and the upland cultivar Kinandang Patong (KP), with deep rooting. This QTL explained 66.6% of the total phenotypic variance in RDR in the RILs. A BC(2)F(3) line homozygous for the KP allele of the QTL had an RDR of 40.4%, compared with 2.6% for the homozygous IR64 allele. Fine mapping of this QTL was undertaken using eight BC(2)F(3) recombinant lines. The RDR QTL Dro1 (Deeper rooting 1) was mapped between the markers RM24393 and RM7424, which delimit a 608.4 kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. To clarify the influence of Dro1 in an upland field, the root distribution in different soil layers was quantified by means of core sampling. A line homozygous for the KP allele of Dro1 (Dro1-KP) and IR64 did not differ in root dry weight in the shallow soil layers (0-25 cm), but root dry weight of Dro1-KP in deep soil layers (25-50 cm) was significantly greater than that of IR64, suggesting that Dro1 plays a crucial role in increased deep rooting under upland field conditions.
ng.2725.pdf	Control of root system architecture by DEEPER ROOTING 1 increases rice yield under drought conditions	2013	Nat Genet	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba, Japan. yuga@nias.affrc.go.jp	The genetic improvement of drought resistance is essential for stable and adequate crop production in drought-prone areas. Here we demonstrate that alteration of root system architecture improves drought avoidance through the cloning and characterization of DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1), a rice quantitative trait locus controlling root growth angle. DRO1 is negatively regulated by auxin and is involved in cell elongation in the root tip that causes asymmetric root growth and downward bending of the root in response to gravity. Higher expression of DRO1 increases the root growth angle, whereby roots grow in a more downward direction. Introducing DRO1 into a shallow-rooting rice cultivar by backcrossing enabled the resulting line to avoid drought by increasing deep rooting, which maintained high yield performance under drought conditions relative to the recipient cultivar. Our experiments suggest that control of root system architecture will contribute to drought avoidance in crops.
NA	INDITTO2 transposon conveys auxin-mediated DRO1 transcription for rice drought avoidance	2021	Plant Cell Environ	College of Plant Protection, Yunnan Agricultural University, Kunming, China.	Transposable elements exist widely throughout plant genomes and play important roles in plant evolution. Auxin is an important regulator that is traditionally associated with root development and drought stress adaptation. The DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene is a key component of rice drought avoidance. Here, we identified a transposon that acts as an autonomous auxin-responsive promoter and its presence at specific genome positions conveys physiological adaptations related to drought avoidance. Rice varieties with a high and auxin-mediated transcription of DRO1 in the root tip show deeper and longer root phenotypes and are thus better adapted to drought. The INDITTO2 transposon contains an auxin response element and displays auxin-responsive promoter activity; it is thus able to convey auxin regulation of transcription to genes in its proximity. In the rice Acuce, which displays DRO1-mediated drought adaptation, the INDITTO2 transposon was found to be inserted at the promoter region of the DRO1 locus. Transgenesis-based insertion of the INDITTO2 transposon into the DRO1 promoter of the non-adapted rice variety Nipponbare was sufficient to promote its drought avoidance. Our data identify an example of how transposons can act as promoters and convey hormonal regulation to nearby loci, improving plant fitness in response to different abiotic stresses.
NA	Allele mining for a drought responsive gene DRO1 determining root growth angle in donors of drought tolerance in rice ( Oryza sativa L.) 	2021	Physiol Mol Biol Plants	Indian Council of Agricultural Research- National Institute for Plant Biotechnology, Pusa campus, New Delhi, India.	Deeper Rooting 1 (DRO1) gene identified from a major QTL on chromosome 9 increases the root growth angle (RGA) and thus facilitates survival under drought and hence is an excellent candidate for rice improvement. Twenty-four major Indian upland and lowland genotypes including the 'yield under drought' (DTY) QTL donors were subjected to allele mining of DRO1 (3058 bp) using four pairs of overlapping primers. A total of 216 and 52 SNPs were identified across all genotypes in the gene and coding region (756 bp) respectively with transversions 3.6 fold more common than transitions in the gene and 2.5 times in the CDS. In 251 amino acid long protein, substitutions were found in 19 positions, wherein change in position 92 was the most frequent. Based on allele mining, the 24 genotypes can be classified into 16 primary structure variants ranging from complete functional allele (Satti, IR36 and DTY 3.1 donor, IR81896-B-B-195) to truncated non-functional alleles in PMK2, IR64, IR20 and Swarna. All the DTY donors, other than IR81896-B-B-195, and most of the upland drought tolerant cultivars (Nagina 22, Vandana and Dhagaddeshi) had accumulated 6-19 SNPs and 4-8 amino acid substitutions resulting in substantial differences in their protein structure. The expression analysis revealed that all the genotypes showed upregulation under drought stress though the degree of upregulation varied among genotypes. The information on structural variations in DRO1 gene will be very useful for the breeders, especially in the light of recent breeding programmes on improving drought tolerance using several DTY donors and upland accessions.
