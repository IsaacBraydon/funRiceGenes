DX1	 In this study, based on microarray and RT-PCR data, we identified a rice green tissue-specific expression gene DX1 (LOC_Os12g33120) |  The expression pattern of DX1 gene promoter was examined by using the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and analyzed in transgenic rice plants in different tissues |  To identify the regulatory elements controlling the expression of the DX1 gene, a series of 5&#39; and 3&#39; deletions of DX1 promoter were fused to GUS gene and stably introduced into rice plants
