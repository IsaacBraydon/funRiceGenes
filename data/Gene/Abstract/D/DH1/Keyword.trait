DH1	stamen	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 In this study, we screened 4416 lab-created T(1) rice T-DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens
DH1	floral	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
DH1	culm	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
DH1	palea	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma
DH1	lemma	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma
DH1	leaf	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
DH1	root	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
DH1	panicle	DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice	 Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma| The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
