DP1	transcription factor	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 The DP1 enhancer SDP1 was also positional cloned, and was found identical to the recently reported RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene encoding a TCP family transcription factor
DP1	flower	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development
DP1	sterile	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants
DP1	sterile	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size
DP1	floral	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 In addition, we found a floral organ number increase in dp1 mutants at low penetration
DP1	floral	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 Both the sterile lemma elongation and the floral organ number increase phenotype are enhanced by the mutation of an independent gene SMALL DEGENERATIVE PALEA1 (SDP1), whose single mutation causes reduced palea size
DP1	floral	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 E function and presumable A function floral homeotic genes were found suppressed in the dp1-2 mutant
DP1	lemma	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 The sterile lemma at the palea side is occasionally elongated in dp1 mutants

DP1	architecture	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 We identified the DP1 gene by map-based cloning and found it encodes a nuclear-localized AT-hook DNA binding protein, suggesting a grass-specific role of chromatin architecture modification in flower development
DP1	palea	An AT-hook gene is required for palea formation and floral organ number control in rice	 The depressed palea1 (dp1) mutants show a primary defect in the main structure of palea, implying that palea is a fusion between the main structure and marginal tissues on both sides
