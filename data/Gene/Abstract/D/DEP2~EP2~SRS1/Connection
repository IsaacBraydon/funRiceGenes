DEP2|EP2|SRS1|OsRELA	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5|GR5	GR5 acts in the G protein pathway to regulate grain size in rice.	 Four downstream target genes of GR5 in grain development (DEP2, DEP3, DRW1, and CyCD5;2) were revealed and their core T/CGCAC motif identified by yeast one-hybrid, EMSA, and ChIP-PCR experiments
