DTC1	DTD|EAT1	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	 Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
DTC1	OsMT2b	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	 DTC1 protein interacts with OsMT2b, a ROS-scavenger
DTC1	TDR	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	 Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
DTC1	Udt1	Defective Tapetum Cell Death 1 (DTC1) Regulates ROS Levels by Binding to Metallothionein during Tapetum Degeneration.	 Moreover, levels of DTC1 transcripts are diminished in udt1, tdr, and eat1 anthers
