Du13	map-based cloning	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	 Map-based cloning showed that Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein
Du13	R protein	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.
Du13	R protein	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	 Map-based cloning showed that Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein
Du13	R protein	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	 Moreover, Du13 also regulates alternative splicing of other protein-coding transcripts and affects the biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs
Du13	endosperm	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	 Du13 coordinates with the nuclear cap-binding complex to regulate the splicing of Wx(b) transcripts in rice endosperm
