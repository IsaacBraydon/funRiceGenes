NA	Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein that regulates Wx(b) pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Amylose content is a crucial physicochemical property responsible for the eating and cooking quality of rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain and is mainly controlled by the Waxy (Wx) gene. Previous studies have identified several Dull genes that modulate the expression of the Wx(b) allele in japonica rice by affecting the splicing efficiency of the Wx(b) pre-mRNA. Here, we uncover dual roles for a novel Dull gene in pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA processing. We isolated the dull mutant, du13, with a dull endosperm and low amylose content. Map-based cloning showed that Du13 encodes a C(2) H(2) zinc-finger protein. Du13 coordinates with the nuclear cap-binding complex to regulate the splicing of Wx(b) transcripts in rice endosperm. Moreover, Du13 also regulates alternative splicing of other protein-coding transcripts and affects the biogenesis of a subset of microRNAs. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved link between pre-mRNA splicing and microRNA biogenesis in rice endosperm. Our findings also provide new insights into the functions of Dull genes in rice and expand our knowledge of microRNA biogenesis in monocots.
NA	Mutation of TL1, encoding a novel C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein, improves grains eating and cooking quality in rice.	2022	Theor Appl Genet	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, 200234, China. zgc1983@shnu.edu.cn.	The cloning and characterization of a novel C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein that affects rice eating and cooking quality by regulating amylose content and amylopectin chain-length distribution in rice. One of the major objectives in rice breeding aims to increase simultaneously yield and grain quality especially eating and cooking quality (ECQ). Controlling amylose content (AC) and amylopectin chain-length distribution (ACLD) in rice is a major strategy for improving rice ECQ. Previous studies show that some starch synthesis-related genes (SSRGs) are required for normal AC and ACLD, but its underlying regulating network is still unclear. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a novel C(2)H(2) zinc finger protein TL1 (Translucent endosperm 1) that positively regulates amylose synthesis in rice grains. Loss of TL1 function reduced apparent amylose content (AAC), total starch, gel consistency, and gelatinisation temperature, whereas increased viscosity, total lipid, and ratio of amylopectin A chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 6-12 to B(1) chains with DP 13-24, resulting in an enhanced grain ECQ. The improved ECQ was accompanied by altered expression patterns of several tested SSRGs in tl1 mutant grains. Furthermore, knockout of TL1 in the high-yielding rice variety JiaHua NO.1 reduced AAC without obvious side effects on major agronomic traits. These findings expand our understanding of the regulating networks of grain starch metabolism and provide new insights into how rice ECQ quality can be improved via genetic approach.
