D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1	 Among the SNDH populations, the analysis of the relative expression level during the panicle formation stage of OsBRKq1 in panicles of SNDH117, which has the largest grain size, and SNDH6, which has the smallest grain size, the relative expression level was significantly increased in SNDH117 panicles |  Therefore, the stable expression level of OsBRKq1 was confirmed via QTL mapping
D61|OsBRI1|OsBRKq1|HFR131	 By combining yeast one-hybrid assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR and gene expression quantification, we demonstrated that OsARF17, an auxin response factor, could bind to the promoter region of HFR131 and positively regulated HFR131 expression, thereby regulating the plant height and grain length, and influencing brassinosteroid sensitivity
