D61|OsBRI1	OsBLE3	OsBLE3, a brassinolide-enhanced gene, is involved in the growth of rice	 In OsBRI1 antisense transgenic rice and OsBLE3, the BR-insensitive mutant expression of OsBLE3 in response to exogenous BL treatment was significantly lower compared to that in control plants transformed with a vacant vector
D61|OsBRI1	TID1|SRS5	Small and round seed 5 gene encodes alpha-tubulin regulating seed cell elongation in rice	 Seeds of the double mutant of Srs5 and d61-2 were smaller than those of Srs5 or d61-2| Furthermore, SRS5 and BRI1 genes were highly expressed in Srs5 and d61-2 mutants
BU1	D61|OsBRI1	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	 Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
D61|OsBRI1	SDG725	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	 Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
D11|CYP724B1	D61|OsBRI1	H3K36 methylation is critical for brassinosteroid-regulated plant growth and development in rice	 Consistently, transcriptome analyses revealed that SDG725 depletion results in down-regulation by more than two-fold of over 1000 genes, including D11, BRI1 and BU1, which are known to be involved in brassinosteroid biosynthesis or signaling pathways
BU1	D61|OsBRI1	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1| These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1
D1|RGA1	D61|OsBRI1	BRASSINOSTEROID UPREGULATED1, encoding a helix-loop-helix protein, is a novel gene involved in brassinosteroid signaling and controls bending of the lamina joint in rice	 In addition, compared to the wild type, the induction of BU1 by exogenous brassinolide did not require de novo protein synthesis and it was weaker in a BR receptor mutant OsbriI (Oryza sativa brassinosteroid insensitive1, d61) and a rice G protein alpha subunit (RGA1) mutant d1| These results indicate that BU1 protein is a positive regulator of BR response: it controls bending of the lamina joint in rice and it is a novel primary response gene that participates in two BR signaling pathways through OsBRI1 and RGA1
D61|OsBRI1	OsBRL1	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	 The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type|The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice
D61|OsBRI1	OsBRL3	The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice	 The homologous genes for OsBRI1, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, were highly expressed in roots but weakly expressed in shoots, and their expression was higher in d61-4 than in the wild type|The role of OsBRI1 and its homologous genes, OsBRL1 and OsBRL3, in rice
D61|OsBRI1	RPL1	RPL1, a gene involved in epigenetic processes regulates phenotypic plasticity in rice	 Analysis of the putative rice brassinosteroid receptor OsBRI1, a key hormone signaling gene, indicated that RPL1 may be involved in the regulation of epigenomic modification of the gene
D61|OsBRI1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae	In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
