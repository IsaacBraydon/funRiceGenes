ers349.pdf	The SNAC1-targeted gene OsSRO1c modulates stomatal closure and oxidative stress tolerance by regulating hydrogen peroxide in rice	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Abiotic stresses such as drought cause a reduction of plant growth and loss of crop yield. Stomatal aperture controls CO(2) uptake and water loss to the atmosphere, thus playing important roles in both the yield gain and drought tolerance of crops. Here, a rice homologue of SRO (similar to RCD one), termed OsSRO1c, was identified as a direct target gene of SNAC1 (stress-responsive NAC 1) involved in the regulation of stomatal aperture and oxidative response. SNAC1 could bind to the promoter of OsSRO1c and activate the expression of OsSRO1c. OsSRO1c was induced in guard cells by drought stress. The loss-of-function mutant of OsSRO1c showed increased stomatal aperture and sensitivity to drought, and faster water loss compared with the wild-type plant, whereas OsSRO1c overexpression led to decreased stomatal aperture and reduced water loss. Interestingly, OsSRO1c-overexpressing rice showed increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Expression of DST, a reported zinc finger gene negatively regulating H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure, and the activity of H(2)O(2)-scavenging related enzymes were significantly suppressed, and H(2)O(2) in guard cells was accumulated in the overexpression lines. OsSRO1c interacted with various stress-related regulatory and functional proteins, and some of the OsSRO1c-interacting proteins are predicted to be involved in the control of stomatal aperture and oxidative stress tolerance. The results suggest that OsSRO1c has dual roles in drought and oxidative stress tolerance of rice by promoting stomatal closure and H(2)O(2) accumulation through a novel pathway involving regulators SNAC1 and DST.
Genes Dev.-2009-Huang-1805-17.pdf	A previously unknown zinc finger protein, DST, regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice via stomatal aperture control	2009	Genes Dev	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.	Abiotic stresses, such as drought and salinity, lead to crop growth damage and a decrease in crop yields. Stomata control CO(2) uptake and optimize water use efficiency, thereby playing crucial roles in abiotic stress tolerance. Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is an important signal molecule that induces stomatal closure. However, the molecular pathway that regulates the H(2)O(2) level in guard cells remains largely unknown. Here, we clone and characterize DST (drought and salt tolerance)-a previously unknown zinc finger transcription factor that negatively regulates stomatal closure by direct modulation of genes related to H(2)O(2) homeostasis-and identify a novel pathway for the signal transduction of DST-mediated H(2)O(2)-induced stomatal closure. Loss of DST function increases stomatal closure and reduces stomatal density, consequently resulting in enhanced drought and salt tolerance in rice. These findings provide an interesting insight into the mechanism of stomata-regulated abiotic stress tolerance, and an important genetic engineering approach for improving abiotic stress tolerance in crops.
PNAS-2013-Li-3167-72.pdf	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) positively regulates the activity and function of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is a major parameter determining seed production. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) Gn1a/OsCKX2 (Grain number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain number improvement in rice breeding practice. However, the molecular mechanism of how the expression of OsCKX2 is regulated in planta remains elusive. Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem. DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs. We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number. Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production. Our study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity, DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain production in rice and other small grain cereals.
NA	Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice.	2014	J Exp Bot	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, PR China.	Drought is a recurring climatic hazard that reduces the crop yields. To avoid the negative effects of drought on crop production, extensive efforts have been devoted to investigating the complex mechanisms of gene expression and signal transduction during drought stress. Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in perceiving extracellular stimuli and activating downstream signalling responses. The rice genome contains &gt;1100 RLK genes, of which only two are reported to function in drought stress. A leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-RLK gene named Leaf Panicle 2 (LP2) was previously found to be strongly expressed in leaves and other photosynthetic tissues, but its function remains unclear. In the present study, it was shown that the expression of LP2 was down-regulated by drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic plants overexpressing LP2 accumulated less H2O2, had more open stomata in leaves, and showed hypersensitivity to drought stress. Further investigation revealed that transcription of LP2 was directly regulated by the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST). In addition, LP2 was identified as a functional kinase localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with the drought-responsive aquaporin proteins OsPIP1; 1, OsPIP1; 3, and OsPIP2; 3. Thus, the findings provided evidence that the LRR-RLK LP2, transcriptionally regulated by the drought-related transcription factor DST, served as a negative regulator in drought response.
NA	Overexpression of a Chimeric Gene, OsDST-SRDX, Improved Salt Tolerance of Perennial Ryegrass.	2016	Sci Rep	Department of Grassland Science, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, P. R. China.	The Drought and Salt Tolerance gene (DST) encodes a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor, which negatively regulates salt tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa). Phylogenetic analysis of six homologues of DST genes in different plant species revealed that DST genes were conserved evolutionarily. Here, the rice DST gene was linked to an SRDX domain for gene expression repression based on the Chimeric REpressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) to make a chimeric gene (OsDST-SRDX) construct and introduced into perennial ryegrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Integration and expression of the OsDST-SRDX in transgenic plants were tested by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. Transgenic lines overexpressing the OsDST-SRDX fusion gene showed obvious phenotypic differences and clear resistance to salt-shock and to continuous salt stresses compared to non-transgenic plants. Physiological analyses including relative leaf water content, electrolyte leakage, proline content, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, H2O2 content and sodium and potassium accumulation indicated that the OsDST-SRDX fusion gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic perennial ryegrass by altering a wide range of physiological responses. To our best knowledge this study is the first report of utilizing Chimeric Repressor gene-Silencing Technology (CRES-T) in turfgrass and forage species for salt-tolerance improvement.
NA	Mediator complex subunit MED25 physically interacts with DST to regulate spikelet number in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Centre for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Grain number is a flexible trait and contributes significantly to grain yield. In rice, the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) controls grain number by directly regulating cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 2 (OsCKX2) expression. Although specific upstream regulators of the DST-OsCKX2 module have been identified, the mechanism employed by DST to regulate the expression of OsCKX2 remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DST-interacting protein 1 (DIP1), known as Mediator subunit OsMED25, acts as an interacting coactivator of DST. Phenotypic analyses revealed that OsMED25-RNAi and the osmed25 mutant plants exhibited enlarged panicles, with enhanced branching and spikelet number, similar to the dst mutant. Genetic analysis indicated that OsMED25 acts in the same pathway as the DST-OsCKX2 module to regulate spikelet number per panicle. Further biochemical analysis showed that OsMED25 physically interacts with DST at the promoter region of OsCKX2, and then recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to activate OsCKX2 transcription. Thus, OsMED25 was involved in the communication between DST and Pol II general transcriptional machinery to regulate spikelet number. In general, our findings reveal a novel function of OsMED25 in DST-OsCKX2 modulated transcriptional regulation, thus enhancing our understanding of the regulatory mechanism underlying DST-OsCKX2-mediated spikelet number.
NA	The APC/CTAD1-WIDE LEAF 1-NARROW LEAF 1 pathway controls leaf width in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	Rice Research Institute, Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, College of Agronomy and Biotechnology, Southwest University, Chongqing 400715, China.	Leaf morphology is one of the most important features of the ideal plant architecture. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling this feature in crops remain largely unknown. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) wide leaf 1 (wl1) mutant, which has wider leaves than the wild type (WT) due to more vascular bundles and greater distance between small vascular bundles. WL1 encodes a Cys-2/His-2-type (C2H2) zinc finger protein that interacts with Tillering and Dwarf 1 (TAD1), a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) (a multi-subunit E3 ligase). The APC/CTAD1 complex degrades WL1 via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome degradation pathway. Loss-of-function of TAD1 resulted in plants with narrow leaves due to reduced vascular bundle numbers and distance between the small vascular bundles. Interestingly, we found that WL1 negatively regulated the expression of a narrow leaf gene, NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), by recruiting the co-repressor TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEIN and directly binding to the NAL1 regulatory region to inhibit its expression by reducing the chromatin histone acetylation. Furthermore, biochemical and genetic analyses revealed that TAD1, WL1, and NAL1 operated in a common pathway to control the leaf width. Our study establishes an important framework for understanding the APC/CTAD1-WL1-NAL1 pathway-mediated control of leaf width in rice, and provides insights for improving crop plant architecture.
