DUA1	WSP1	The RNA editing factor DUA1 is crucial to chloroplast development at low temperature in rice.	 The RNA editing cofactor WSP1, a partner of DUA1, also participates in chloroplast development at low temperature
DUA1	WSP1	The RNA editing factor DUA1 is crucial to chloroplast development at low temperature in rice.	 Western blot analysis indicates that WSP1 enhances DUA1 stability under low temperatures
DUA1	OsSIG1	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice	 Furthermore, we demonstrated that sigma factor OsSIG1 interacted with DUA1 in vitro and in vivo
DUA1	OsSIG1	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice	 Our study reveals that the PPR protein DUA1 plays an important role in regulating PEP-mediated chloroplast gene expression through interacting with OsSIG1, thus modulates chloroplast development in response to environmental signals
