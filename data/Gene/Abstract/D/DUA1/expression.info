DUA1	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice |  In this study, we showed that mutation in DUA1, which encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein in rice (Oryza sativa), led to deficiency in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis, impaired photosystems, and reduced expression of PEP-dependent transcripts at low temperature especially under low-light conditions |  Our study reveals that the PPR protein DUA1 plays an important role in regulating PEP-mediated chloroplast gene expression through interacting with OsSIG1, thus modulates chloroplast development in response to environmental signals
