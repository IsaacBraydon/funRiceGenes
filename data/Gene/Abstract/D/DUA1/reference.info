NA	The RNA editing factor DUA1 is crucial to chloroplast development at low temperature in rice.	2018	New Phytol	Biotechnology Research Institute/National Key Facility for Genetic Resources and Gene Improvement, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Low temperature stress hinders plant growth and chloroplast development and can limit the geographic range of cultivars. In rice, japonica cultivars have greater chilling tolerance than indica cultivars, but the molecular mechanism underlying chilling tolerance is unclear. Here, we report an RNA-binding protein, DUA1, cloned from the indica cultivar Dular, which exhibits a deficiency in chloroplast development at an early stage of development under low-temperature conditions. DUA1 shares high sequence homology with the pentatricopeptide repeat family and functions in plastid RNA editing under low-temperature conditions. Our data suggest that DUA1 can bind to the plastid-encoded rps8-182 transcript and disruption of DUA1 activity impairs editing. The RNA editing cofactor WSP1, a partner of DUA1, also participates in chloroplast development at low temperature. Western blot analysis indicates that WSP1 enhances DUA1 stability under low temperatures. DUA1 sequence analyses of rice core germplasm revealed that three major haplotypes of DUA1 and one haplotype showed substantial differences in chlorophyll content under low-temperature conditions. Variation at DUA1 may play an important role in the adaptation of rice to different growing regions.
NA	A pentatricopeptide repeat protein DUA1 interacts with sigma factor 1 to regulate chloroplast gene expression in Rice	2020	Photosynth Res	Key Laboratory of Photobiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Chloroplast gene expression is controlled by both plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) and nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase and is crucial for chloroplast development and photosynthesis. Environmental factors such as light and temperature can influence transcription in chloroplasts. In this study, we showed that mutation in DUA1, which encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein in rice (Oryza sativa), led to deficiency in chloroplast development and chlorophyll biosynthesis, impaired photosystems, and reduced expression of PEP-dependent transcripts at low temperature especially under low-light conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that sigma factor OsSIG1 interacted with DUA1 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the levels of chlorophyll and PEP-dependent gene expression were significantly decreased in the Ossig1 mutants at low-temperature and low-light conditions. Our study reveals that the PPR protein DUA1 plays an important role in regulating PEP-mediated chloroplast gene expression through interacting with OsSIG1, thus modulates chloroplast development in response to environmental signals.
