DL	 awn 	The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice	The awn is a long needle-like appendage that, in some grass species, is formed on the lemma that encloses floral organs together with the palea| Here, we found that the genes DROOPING LEAF (DL) and OsETTIN2 (OsETT2) are involved in awn development in the awned indica strain Kasalath| Genetic analyses and RNA-silencing experiments indicate that DL and OsETT2 act independently in awn formation, and that either gene alone is not sufficient for awn development| OsETT2 is expressed in the awn primordium in the awned indica floret, but not in the awnless japonica floret except in the provascular bundle
DL	leaf	A transposon, Ping, is integrated into intron 4 of the DROOPING LEAF gene of rice, weakly reducing its expression and causing a mild drooping leaf phenotype	The YABBY gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) regulates midrib formation in the leaves and carpel specification in the flowers of rice (Oryza sativa L)| By comparing the expression levels of DL and leaf phenotypes in the dl mutants with different severities, we confirmed our previous hypothesis that DL promotes cell proliferation in the central region of leaf primordia, and that this cell proliferation is critical for midrib formation in the mature leaves
