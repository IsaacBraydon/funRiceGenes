DPW3|PL1	plasma membrane	A Silent Exonic Mutation in a Rice Integrin-¦Á FG-GAP Repeat-Containing Gene Causes Male-Sterility by Affecting mRNA Splicing.	 PL1 is highly expressed in the tapetal cells of developing anther, and its protein is co-localized with plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal
