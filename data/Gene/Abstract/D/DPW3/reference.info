NA	Defective Pollen Wall 3 (DPW3), a novel alpha integrin-like protein, is required for pollen wall formation in rice.	2019	New Phytol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.	â€¢In flowering plants, pollen wall is a specialized extracellular cell wall matrix surrounding male gametophytes and acts as a natural protector of pollen grains against various environmental and biological stresses. The formation of pollen wall is a complex but well-regulated process, which involves the action of many different genes. However, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. â€¢In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel rice male sterile mutant, defective pollen wall3 (dpw3), which displays smaller and paler anthers with aborted pollen grains. DPW3 encodes a novel membrane-associated alpha integrin-like protein conserved in land plants. DPW3 is ubiquitously expressed in anther developmental stages and its protein is localized to plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi. â€¢dpw3 anthers exhibited unbalanced anther cuticular profile, abnormal Ubisch bodies, disrupted callose deposition, defective pollen wall formation such as abnormal microspore plasma membrane undulation, defective primexine formation, resulting in pollen abortion and complete male sterility. â€¢Our findings revealed a novel and vital role of alpha integrin-like proteins, in plant male reproduction.

NA	A Silent Exonic Mutation in a Rice Integrin-¦Á FG-GAP Repeat-Containing Gene Causes Male-Sterility by Affecting mRNA Splicing.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China.	Pollen development plays crucial roles in the life cycle of higher plants. Here we characterized a rice mutant with complete male-sterile phenotype, pollen-less 1 (pl1). pl1 exhibited smaller anthers with arrested pollen development, absent Ubisch bodies, necrosis-like tapetal hypertrophy, and smooth anther cuticular surface. Molecular mapping revealed a synonymous mutation in the fourth exon of PL1 co-segregated with the mutant phenotype. This mutation disrupts the exon-intron splice junction in PL1, generating aberrant mRNA species and truncated proteins. PL1 is highly expressed in the tapetal cells of developing anther, and its protein is co-localized with plasma membrane (PM) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) signal. PL1 encodes an integrin-¦Á FG-GAP repeat-containing protein, which has seven ¦Â-sheets and putative Ca2+-binding motifs and is broadly conserved in terrestrial plants. Our findings therefore provide insights into both the role of integrin-¦Á FG-GAP repeat-containing protein in rice male fertility and the influence of exonic mutation on intronic splice donor site selection.
NA	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	Shanghai Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, 100 Guilin Road, Shanghai, 200234, China.	Background: During anther development, the tapetum provides essential nutrients and materials for pollen development. In rice, multiple transcription factors and enzymes essential for tapetum development and pollen wall formation have been cloned from male-sterile lines.  Results: In this study, we obtained several lines in which the MYB transcription factor OsMS188 was knocked out through the CRISPR-Cas9 approach. The osms188 lines exhibited a male-sterile phenotype with aberrant development and degeneration of tapetal cells, absence of the sexine layer and defective anther cuticles. CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice. Plants with mutations in these genes are male sterile, with a defective sexine layer and anther cuticle. Further biochemical assays demonstrated that OsMS188 binds directly to the promoters of these genes to regulate their expression. UDT1, OsTDF1, TDR, bHLH142 and EAT1 are upstream regulators of rice tapetum development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and activation assays revealed that TDR directly regulates OsMS188 expression. Additionally, protein interaction assays indicated that TDR interacts with OsMS188 to regulate downstream gene expression.  Conclusion: Overall, OsMS188 is a key regulator of tapetum development and pollen wall formation. The gene regulatory network established in this work may facilitate future investigations of fertility regulation in rice and in other crop species.
