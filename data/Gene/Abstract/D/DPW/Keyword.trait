DPW	sterile	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
DPW	sterile	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Moreover, we demonstrate that the monocot DPW from rice complements the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana male sterile2 (ms2) mutant and is the probable ortholog of MS2
DPW	microspore	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
DPW	anther	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
DPW	anther	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Chemical analysis revealed that dpw anthers had a dramatic reduction in cutin monomers and an altered composition of cuticular wax, as well as soluble fatty acids and alcohols
DPW	anther	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
DPW	anther	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
DPW	tapetal	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
DPW	pollen	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
DPW	pollen	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
DPW	anther development	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
DPW	anther development	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
DPW	grain	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
DPW	cuticle	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
DPW	cutin	Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase	Chemical analysis revealed that dpw anthers had a dramatic reduction in cutin monomers and an altered composition of cuticular wax, as well as soluble fatty acids and alcohols
