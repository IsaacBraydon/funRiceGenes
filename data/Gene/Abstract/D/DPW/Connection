DPW	OsPKS1|YY2|OsLAP6	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
DPW	OsPKS2	OsMS188 Is a Key Regulator of Tapetum Development and Sporopollenin Synthesis in Rice	 CYP703A3, CYP704B2, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, DPW and ABCG15 are sporopollenin synthesis and transport-related genes in rice
AMD1|PWA1	DPW	Grass-specific ABERRANT MICROSPORE DEVELOPMENT 1 is required for maintaining pollen fertility in rice.	 Further biochemical assays indicate that AMD1 directly activates the transcription of DEFECTIVE POLLEN WALL (DPW) and POLYKETIDE SYNTHASE2 (OsPKS2), which are both implicated in sporopollenin biosynthesis during exine formation
