D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	 Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling
D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	 Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation
D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	 Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14-D3 complex

D3	D53	D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling	 The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception
D3	D53	D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling	 We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth
