D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling
D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation
D3	D53	DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice	Our results suggest a model of SL signalling that involves SL-dependent degradation of the D53 repressor mediated by the D14-D3 complex

D3	D53	D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling	The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception
D3	D53	D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling	We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth

D53	HTD2|D88|D14	Identification and Molecular Mapping of Indica High-tillering Dwarf Mutant htd4, a Mild Phenotype Allelic Mutant of D14 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that expression levels of the genes D10, D17, D27, D3, and D14 increased significantly while expression of D53 decreased in htd4, compared to the wild type
D53	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.
D53	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	 Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression
D53	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	 We showed that D53 interacts with IPA1 in vivo and in vitro and suppresses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1
D53	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	 We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression
D53	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice.	 These findings reveal that IPA1 is likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice
