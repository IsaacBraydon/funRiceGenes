AOX1a|OsAOX1a	DCW11	DCW11, down-regulated gene 11 in CW-type cytoplasmic male sterile rice, encoding mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2c is related to cytoplasmic male sterility	 This idea was supported by the up-regulation of alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a), which is known to be regulated by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, in DCW11 knockdown lines| Down-regulation of DCW11 and up-regulation of AOX1a were also observed in two other types of rice CMS
DCW11	OsNek3	Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11	 Here we show the relationship between OsNek3 and DCW11| OsNek3 was shown to be down-regulated in DCW11-knockdown lines, whereas osnek3 mutation did not result in DCW11 down-regulation| These results suggest that OsNek3 is downstream of DCW11 in retrograde signaling from the mitochondria to the nucleus and is involved in CW-CMS|Cytoplasmic male sterility-related protein kinase, OsNek3, is regulated downstream of mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2C, DCW11
