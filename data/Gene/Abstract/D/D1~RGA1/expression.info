Symbol	Expression
D1|RGA1	 We have shown that null mutation of RGA1, encoding the canonical G¦Á subunit of the rice heterotrimeric G protein, improves photoavoidance and photoprotection and modulates the expression of related genes
D1|RGA1|LW5	 The detection results of 15N-ammonium nitrate and an expression analysis of genes associated with nitrogen demonstrated that LW5 serves an important role in nitrate uptake and transport
