DEAP1	development	DEAP1 encodes a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein required for male fertility in rice.	 DEAP1 encodes a plasma membrane-associated member of group III plant FLAs and is specifically and temporally expressed in reproductive cells and the tapetum layer during male development
DEAP1	development	DEAP1 encodes a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein required for male fertility in rice.	 Gene expression studies revealed reduced transcript accumulation of genes related to exine formation, aperture patterning, and tapetum development in deap1 mutants
DEAP1	development	DEAP1 encodes a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein required for male fertility in rice.	 Moreover, DEAP1 may interact with two rice D6 PROTEIN KINASE-LIKE3s (OsD6PKL3s), homologs of a known Arabidopsis aperture protein, to affect rice pollen aperture development
DEAP1	development	DEAP1 encodes a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein required for male fertility in rice.
