DVB1	vascular bundle	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that DVB1 encodes a structural protein classified in the Mic10 family and is required for the formation of cristae in mitochondria, and was primarily expressed in vascular bundles
DVB1	auxin	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 Comparing with the wild type, disruption of amino acid metabolism and increased auxin synthesis were observed in dvb1 mutant which also showed increased sensitivity to the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors
DVB1	development	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 Further studies indicated that DVB1 is important for mitochondrial and plant development in rice
DVB1	plant development	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 Further studies indicated that DVB1 is important for mitochondrial and plant development in rice
DVB1	mitochondria	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 The DVB1 protein is partially localized in the mitochondria and capable of forming dimers and polymers
DVB1	mitochondria	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: DVB1 belongs to Mic10 family and DVB1 is partially localized in the mitochondria
DVB1	map-based cloning	Decreased Vascular Bundle 1 affects mitochondrial and plant development in rice.	 Map-based cloning, genetic complementation, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that DVB1 encodes a structural protein classified in the Mic10 family and is required for the formation of cristae in mitochondria, and was primarily expressed in vascular bundles
