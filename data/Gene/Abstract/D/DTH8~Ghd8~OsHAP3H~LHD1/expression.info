Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8	 EF8 was expressed in various tissues, especially in leaves, with a rhythmic expression pattern |  Our data showed that EF8 delayed flowering time under long-day conditions by altering the rhythmic expression patterns of 'florigen' genes Hd3a and RFT1 |  We also found that EF8 negatively regulates the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	 We find that a dominant promoter type of subspecies japonica displayed a high activity for Ghd8 expression in comparison with the one in indica |  Transgenic analyses revealed that higher expression levels of Ghd8 delayed heading date and enhanced cold tolerance in rice |  Furthermore, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (T1279G) at the position -1279 bp that locates on the potential GA-responsive motif in the Ghd8 promoter affected the expression of this gene |  The 1279â€‰T variant has elevated expression of Ghd8, thus conferring increased cold tolerance of rice seedlings
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	The results of this study help to elucidate the genetic and molecular bases of Ghd8 and Ghd7 interactions, indicating that Ghd8 acts upstream of Ghd7 to activate its transcription, which inhibits Hd3a expression and thus affects flowering time and rice adaptation
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	 However, under LD conditions, Hd1 promotes Ghd7 expression and is recruited by Ghd7 and/or DTH8 to form repressive complexes that collaboratively suppress the Ehd1-Hd3a/RFT1 pathway to block heading, but under SD conditions Hd1 competes with the complexes to promote Hd3a/RFT1 expression, playing a tradeoff relationship with PS flowering
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1|EF8|CAR8|OsNF-YB11	 The triple complex of Ghd8-OsHAP5C-Ghd7 directly bound to the promotor of Hd3a and downregulated the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1, and finally resulted in a delayed heading
