d18|OsGA3ox2	OsACO1	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice	 These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA2ox1	OsDOG, a gibberellin-induced A20/AN1 zinc-finger protein, negatively regulates gibberellin-mediated cell elongation in rice	 Additional GA(1) and real-time PCR quantitative assay analyses confirmed that the decrease of GA(1) in the overexpression lines resulted from reduced expression of GA3ox2 and enhanced expression of GA2ox1 and GA2ox3

d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 The repression of GA3ox2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsYABBY1|OsYAB1	The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism	 Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA3ox2

d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA3ox1	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	 Molecular and linkage analysis maps the OsGA3ox1 gene to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5; the OsGA3ox2 gene maps to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1 that corresponds to the D18 locus
d18|OsGA3ox2	OsGA3ox1	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
d18|OsGA3ox2	GD1	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	 Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
