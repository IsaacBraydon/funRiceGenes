d18|OsGA3ox2	 ga 	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	To confirm the functions of GA in rice, I used dwarf mutant d18-dy
d18|OsGA3ox2	 ga 	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	In addition, d18-dy mutation and GA did not affect expression levels of downstream genes of miR156
d18|OsGA3ox2	shoot	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node–internode differentiation in stem
d18|OsGA3ox2	leaf	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node–internode differentiation in stem
d18|OsGA3ox2	gibberellin	Cloning and functional analysis of two gibberellin 3 beta -hydroxylase genes that are differently expressed during the growth of rice	We have cloned two gibberellin (GA) 3 beta-hydroxylase genes, OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2, from rice by screening a genomic library with a DNA fragment obtained by PCR using degenerate primers
d18|OsGA3ox2	dwarf	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	To confirm the functions of GA in rice, I used dwarf mutant d18-dy
d18|OsGA3ox2	 ga 	The rice GERMINATION DEFECTIVE 1, encoding a B3 domain transcriptional repressor, regulates seed germination and seedling development by integrating GA and carbohydrate metabolism	Consistent with the dwarf phenotype of gd1, expression of the gibberelic acid (GA) inactivation gene OsGA2ox3 is increased dramatically, accompanied by reduced expression of GA biosynthetic genes including OsGA20ox1, OsGA20ox2 and OsGA3ox2 in gd1, resulting in a decreased endogenous GA(4) level
d18|OsGA3ox2	stem	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node–internode differentiation in stem
d18|OsGA3ox2	meristem	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node–internode differentiation in stem
d18|OsGA3ox2	 ga 	The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice	These findings indicate that phytochromes contribute to multiple steps in the control of internode elongation, such as the expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsGA3ox2, ACO1 expression, and the onset of internode elongation
d18|OsGA3ox2	shoot apical meristem	Gibberellin is not a regulator of miR156 in rice juvenile-adult phase change	d18-dy mutant exhibited long juvenile phase in morphological traits such as the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), shape of leaf blades, presence or absence of midribs and node–internode differentiation in stem

d18|OsGA3ox2	GA biosynthetic	Brassinosteroid regulates cell elongation by modulating gibberellin metabolism in rice	BR greatly induces the expression of D18/GA3ox-2, one of the GA biosynthetic genes, leading to increased GA1 levels, the bioactive GA in rice seedlings.
