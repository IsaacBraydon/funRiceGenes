DEL1	leaf	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 Our research indicates that DEL1 is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence
DEL1	leaf senescence	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 Our research indicates that DEL1 is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence
DEL1	senescence	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function and senescence related gene expression was altered in del1 plants

DEL1	cell division	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 Our research indicates that DEL1 is involved in both the maintenance of normal cell division and the induction of leaf senescence
DEL1	cell wall	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 Functional analysis revealed that mutation of DEL1 decreased the total PEL enzymatic activity, increased the degree of methylesterified homogalacturonan and altered the cell wall composition and structure
DEL1	cell wall	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 In addition, transcriptome assay revealed that a set of cell wall function and senescence related gene expression was altered in del1 plants
DEL1	cell cycle	A rice PECTATE LYASE-LIKE gene is required for plant growth and leaf senescence.	 Further investigation revealed that the decline in cell number in del1 was affected by the cell cycle
