DBS1|OsNACK	root	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
DBS1|OsNACK	growth	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
DBS1|OsNACK	growth	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis
DBS1|OsNACK	dwarf	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
DBS1|OsNACK	shoot	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
DBS1|OsNACK	shoot	The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development	 Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
