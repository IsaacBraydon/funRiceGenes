Flavonoids play important roles in root development and in its tropic responses, whereas the flavonoids-mediated changes of the global transcription levels during root growth remain unclear. Here, the global transcription changes in quercetin-treated rice primary roots were analyzed. Quercetin treatment significantly induced the inhibition of root growth and the reduction of H<U+2082>O<U+2082> and O<U+2082>- levels. In addition, the RNA-seq analysis revealed that there are 1243 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in quercetin-treated roots, including 1032 up-regulated and 211 down-regulated genes. A gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the enriched GO terms are mainly associated with the cell wall organization, response to oxidative stress, and response to hormone stimulus. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment pathway analysis showed that the enriched DEGs are involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, the quercetin treatment led to an increase of the antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rice roots. Also, the quercetin treatment altered the DR5:GUS expression pattern in the root tips. All of these data indicated that the flavonoids-mediated transcription changes of genes are related to the genes involved in cell wall remodeling, redox homeostasis, and auxin signaling, leading to a reduced cell division in the meristem zone and cell elongation in the elongation zone of roots.
