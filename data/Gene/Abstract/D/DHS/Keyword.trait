DHS	drought	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 The cuticular wax contents were significantly reduced in DHS overexpression plants but increased in dhs mutants compared to the wild type, which resulted in a response opposite that of drought stress
DHS	stress	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 The cuticular wax contents were significantly reduced in DHS overexpression plants but increased in dhs mutants compared to the wild type, which resulted in a response opposite that of drought stress
DHS	Ubiquitin	The E3 Ligase DROUGHT HYPERSENSITIVE Negatively Regulates Cuticular Wax Biosynthesis by Promoting the Degradation of Transcription Factor ROC4 in Rice.	 DHS exhibited E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and interacted with the homeodomain-leucine zipper IV protein ROC4
