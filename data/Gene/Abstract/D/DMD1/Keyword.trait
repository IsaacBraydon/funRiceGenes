DMD1	transcription factor	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 DMD1 interacts with Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for exine formation
DMD1	development	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 DMD1 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores during postmeiotic development
DMD1	development	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Taken together, our results suggest that DMD1 is responsible for microspore cell integrity, primexine formation, and exine pattern formation during rice microspore development
DMD1	sterile	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Mutations in DMD1 cause a male sterile phenotype with impaired microspore cell integrity
DMD1	tapetum	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 DMD1 is preferentially expressed in the tapetum and microspores during postmeiotic development
DMD1	tapetum	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 DMD1 interacts with Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor required for exine formation
DMD1	microspore	Defective Microspore Development1 is required for microspore cell integrity and pollen wall formation in rice.	 Mutations in DMD1 cause a male sterile phenotype with impaired microspore cell integrity
