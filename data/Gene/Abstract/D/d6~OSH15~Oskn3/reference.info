000992.pdf	Loss-of-function mutations in the rice homeobox gene OSH15 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants	1999	EMBO J	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, USA.	The rice homeobox gene OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox) is a member of the knotted1-type homeobox gene family. We report here on the identification and characterization of a loss-of-function mutation in OSH15 from a library of retrotransposon-tagged lines of rice. Based on the phenotype and map position, we have identified three independent deletion alleles of the locus among conventional morphological mutants. All of these recessive mutations, which are considered to be null alleles, exhibit defects in internode elongation. Introduction of a 14 kbp genomic DNA fragment that includes all exons, introns and 5'- and 3'- flanking sequences of OSH15 complemented the defects in internode elongation, confirming that they were caused by the loss-of-function of OSH15. Internodes of the mutants had abnormal-shaped epidermal and hypodermal cells and showed an unusual arrangement of small vascular bundles. These mutations demonstrate a role for OSH15 in the development of rice internodes. This is the first evidence that the knotted1-type homeobox genes have roles other than shoot apical meristem formation and/or maintenance in plant development.

Five rice homeobox (OSH) genes were overexpressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter or the rice actin gene promoter in transgenic rice plants. Almost all of the transgenic plants showed abnormal phenotypes, which could be classified into three types according to their severity. Plants with the most severe phenotype formed only green organs, with many shoot apices on their adaxial sides. Plants with an intermediate phenotype formed bladeless leaves with normally developed leaf sheaths. Plants with a mild phenotype formed normal leaf sheaths and blades, but lacked ligules and showed diffusion of the blade-sheath boundary. The leaf structure of this phenotype was similar to that of dominant maize mutants, such as Kn1, Rs1, Lg3, and Lg4. Based on these phenotypes, we suggest that ectopic expression of the rice OSH genes interferes with the development of leaf blades and maintains leaves in less differentiated states. These results are discussed in relation to the leaf maturation schedule hypothesis (M. Freeling et al., 1992, BioEssays 14, 227-236).
1-s2.0-S0168945208000022-main.pdf	Disruption of KNOX gene suppression in leaf by introducing its cDNA in rice	2008	Plant Science	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka-ken 411-8540, Japan	KNOX class 1 homeobox genes play a crucial role in formation and/or maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in plants, and their SAM-specific expression is essential for normal development of plants. We examined regulation of expression of OSH1, a KNOX gene in rice. A 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> upstream region of OSH1 had the ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene in leaf in addition to the SAM. Introduction of OSH1 cDNA without a promoter sequence caused ectopic expression of both endogenous OSH1 and introduced OSH1 cDNA itself into the leaf, which resulted in morphological abnormalities in the leaf resembling those of the overexpressors. These results indicate that an extra copy of OSH1 exons with no promoter sequence disrupts suppression of OSH1 in the transgenic leaf. Introduction of cDNAs of two other KNOX genes, OSH15 and OSH71, also showed ectopic expression. These results suggest that the exon sequences of KNOX genes function as one of the major cis-regulatory elements of KNOX gene expression. We present and discuss a possible model which interprets these results.

In vascular plants, the regulation of stem cell niche determines development of aerial shoot which consists of stems and lateral organs. Intercalary meristem (IM) controls internode elongation in rice and other grasses, however little attention has been paid to the underlying mechanism of stem cell maintenance. Here, we investigated the stem development in rice and showed that the Shortened Uppermost Internode 1 (SUI1) family of genes are pivotal for development of rice stems. We demonstrated that SUI-family genes regulate the development of IM for internode elongation and also the cell expansion of the panicle stem rachis in rice. The SUI-family genes encoded base-exchange types of phosphatidylserine synthases (PSSs), which possessed enzymatic activity in a yeast complementary assay. Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired. Furthermore, genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that overexpression and RNA knockdown of SUI-family genes affected downstream gene expression related to phospholipid metabolic pathways. Moreover, using Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometry, we analyzed PS contents in different genetic backgrounds of rice and showed that the quantity of very long chain fatty acids PS is affected by transgene of SUI-family genes. Our study reveals a new mechanism conveyed by the SUI1 pathway and provides evidence to link lipid metabolism with plant stem cell maintenance.
10.1023-A-1006065622251.pdf	Isolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15	1998	Plant Mol Biol	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Japan.	In many eukaryotic organisms including plants, homeobox genes are thought to be master regulators that establish the cellular or regional identities and specify the fundamental body plan. We isolated and characterized a cDNA designated OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15) that encodes a KNOTTED-type homeodomain protein. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing the OSH15 cDNA showed a dramatically altered morphological phenotype caused by disturbance of specific aspects of tobacco development, thereby indicating the involvement of OSH15 in plant development. We analyzed the in situ mRNA localization of OSH15 through the whole plant life cycle, comparing the expression pattern with that of another rice homeobox gene, OSH1. In early embryogenesis, both genes were expressed as the same pattern at a region where the shoot apical meristem would develop later. In late embryogenesis, the expression pattern of the two genes became different. Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs. This pattern of expression was similar to that observed around vegetative or reproductive shoots, or the floral meristem in mature plants. RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem.
10.1023-A-1006153506868.pdf	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis	1999	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, The Netherlands.	For identification of genes involved in embryogenesis in the model cereal rice, we have constructed a collection of cDNA libraries of well-defined stages of embryo development before, during and after organ differentiation. Here, we focus on the possible role of KNOX (maize Knotted1-like) class homeobox genes in regulation of rice embryogenesis. Three types of KNOX clones were identified in libraries of early zygotic embryos. Two of these, Oskn2 and Oskn3, encode newly described KNOX genes, whereas the third (Oskn1) corresponds to the previously described OSH1 gene. In situ hybridizations showed that during the early stages of embryo development, all three KNOX genes are expressed in the region where the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is organizing, suggesting that these genes are involved in regulating SAM formation. Whereas OSH1 was previously proposed to function also in SAM maintenance, Oskn3 may be involved in patterning organ positions, as its expression was found to mark the boundaries of different embryonic organs following SAM formation. The expression pattern of Oskn2 suggested an additional role in scutellum and epiblast development. Transgenic expression of Oskn2 and Oskn3 in tobacco further supported their involvement in cell fate determination, like previously reported for Knotted1 and OSH1 ectopic expression. Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology. The observation that the KNOX genes produce similar though distinct phenotypic reponses in tobacco, indicates that their gene products act on overlapping but different sets of target genes, or that cell-type specific factors determine their precise action.
10.1023-A-1014047917226.pdf	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice	2002	Plant Mol Biol	Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, Clusius Laboratory, The Netherlands.	Plant homeobox genes of the class 1 knox (knotted1-like) type are involved in the regulation of shoot apical meristem formation and function. Their expression generally occurs either throughout the meristem or specifically at the lateral organ boundaries. Down-regulation in the organ primordia is tightly controlled and misexpression in leaves leads to a perturbed development. Here, the transcriptional control of two rice knox genes, Oskn2 and Oskn3, was addressed, showing that the promoter sequences of both genes mediate the initial down-regulation during lateral organ formation, but are insufficient to keep expression in lateral organs stably off. Therefore, maintenance of the repressed state requires control elements outside the promoter regions. Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching. internode elongation and leaf patterning. However, small differences suggested that their target gene specificities are not completely overlapping. This was supported by the observation that Oskn3 protein but not Oskn2 could interact with two reported recognition sequences of a KNOX protein from barley. Finally, protein-protein interactions may contribute to the functioning of KNOX proteins, as the ability of Oskn3 and Oskn2 to form heterodimers could be demonstrated.
1069_ftp.pdf	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	2001	Genesis	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan.	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages. Transgenic calli transferred onto regeneration medium began to display green spots, a sign of regeneration, but most of the transformants continued to propagate green spots at given stages. In the normal shoot-regeneration process of calli, expression of endogenous OSH1 was restricted in presumptive shoot-regenerating regions of calli and not observed in other areas. This restricted expression pattern should be required for further differentiation of the regenerating shoots. Thus our present results support the proposed function that KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes play a role in the formation and maintenance of the undetermined meristematic state of cells.
111651.pdf	Regional expression of the rice KN1-type homeobox gene family during embryo, shoot, and flower development	1999	Plant Cell	Nagoya University, BioScience Center, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	We report the isolation, sequence, and pattern of gene expression of members of the KNOTTED1 (KN1)-type class 1 homeobox gene family from rice. Phylogenetic analysis and mapping of the rice genome revealed that all of the rice homeobox genes that we have isolated have one or two direct homologs in maize. Of the homeobox genes that we tested, all exhibited expression in a restricted region of the embryo that defines the position at which the shoot apical meristem (SAM) would eventually develop, prior to visible organ formation. Several distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns were observed for the different genes in this region. After shoot formation, the expression patterns of these homeobox genes were variable in the region of the SAM. These results suggest that the rice KN1-type class 1 homeobox genes function cooperatively to establish the SAM before shoot formation and that after shoot formation, their functions differ.
4368.pdf	Positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is essential for shoot apical meristem maintenance in rice	2011	Plant Cell	Genetic Strains Research Center, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka, Japan.	Self-maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), from which aerial organs are formed throughout the life cycle, is crucial in plant development. Class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes restrict cell differentiation and play an indispensable role in maintaining the SAM. However, the mechanism that positively regulates their expression is unknown. Here, we show that expression of a rice (Oryza sativa) KNOX gene, Oryza sativa homeobox1 (OSH1), is positively regulated by direct autoregulation. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutants of OSH1 lose the SAM just after germination but can be rescued to grow until reproductive development when they are regenerated from callus. Double mutants of osh1 and d6, a loss-of-function mutant of OSH15, fail to establish the SAM both in embryogenesis and regeneration. Expression analyses in these mutants reveal that KNOX gene expression is positively regulated by the phytohormone cytokinin and by KNOX genes themselves. We demonstrate that OSH1 directly binds to five KNOX loci, including OSH1 and OSH15, through evolutionarily conserved cis-elements and that the positive autoregulation of OSH1 is indispensable for its own expression and SAM maintenance. Thus, the maintenance of the indeterminate state mediated by positive autoregulation of a KNOX gene is an indispensable mechanism of self-maintenance of the SAM.
PC13092085.pdf	Functional analysis of the conserved domains of a rice KNOX homeodomain protein, OSH15	2001	Plant Cell	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-0814, Japan.	The rice KNOX protein OSH15 consists of four conserved domains: the MEINOX domain, which can be divided into two subdomains (KNOX1 and KNOX2); the GSE domain; the ELK domain; and the homeodomain (HD). To investigate the function of each domain, we generated 10 truncated proteins with deletions in the conserved domains and four proteins with mutations in the conserved amino acids in the HD. Transgenic analysis suggested that KNOX2 and HD are essential for inducing the abnormal phenotype and that the KNOX1 and ELK domains affect phenotype severity. We also found that both KNOX2 and HD are necessary for homodimerization and that only HD is needed for binding of OSH15 to its target sequence. Transactivation studies suggested that both the KNOX1 and ELK domains play a role in suppressing target gene expression. On the basis of these findings, we propose that overproduced OSH15 probably acts as a dimer and may ectopically suppress the expression of target genes that induce abnormal morphology in transgenic plants.
NA	KNOX Protein OSH15 Induces Grain Shattering by Repressing Lignin Biosynthesis Genes.	2017	Plant Physiol	Kyung Hee University CITY: Yongin Korea (South), Republic Of.	Seed shattering is an agronomically important trait. Two major domestication factors are responsible for this: qSH1 and SH5. Whereas qSH1 functions in cell differentiation in the abscission zone (AZ), a major role of SH5 is repression of lignin deposition. We have determined that a KNOX protein, OSH15, also controls seed shattering. Knockdown mutations of OSH15 showed reduced seed shattering phenotypes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that OSH15 interacts with SH5 and qSH1, two proteins in the BELL homeobox family. In transgenic plants carrying the OSH15 promoter-GUS reporter construct, the reporter gene was preferentially expressed in the AZ during young spikelet development. The RNA in situ hybridization experiment also showed that OSH15 mRNAs were abundant in the AZ during spikelet development. Analyses of osh15 SH5-D double mutants showed that SH5 could not increase the degree of seed shattering when OSH15 was absent, indicating that SH5 functions together with OSH15. In addition to the seed shattering phenotype, osh15 mutants displayed dwarfism and accumulated a higher amount of lignin in internodes due to increased expression of the genes involved in lignin biosynthesis. Knockout mutations of CAD2, which encodes an enzyme for the last step in the monolignol biosynthesis pathway, caused an easy seed shattering phenotype by reducing lignin deposition in the AZ. This indicated that the lignin level is an important determinant of seed shattering in rice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that both OSH15 and SH5 directly interact with CAD2 chromatin. We conclude that OSH15 and SH5 form a dimer that enhances seed shattering by directly inhibiting lignin biosynthesis genes.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
NA	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	The plant cell wall provides mechanical strength to support plant growth and development and to determine plant architecture. Cellulose and mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) present in primary cell wall, whereas cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose exist in secondary cell wall. Biosynthesis of the cell wall biopolymers needs the coordinated transcriptional regulation of all the biosynthetic genes. The module of OsmiR166b-OsHox32 regulates expression levels of the genes related to biosynthesis of MLG, cellulose and lignin. Transgenic plants knocking down miR166b (STTM166b) by short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology or overexpressing OsHox32 (OEHox32) showed drooping leaves and brittle culms. Due to accumulation of less lignin and cellulose, the cell wall thickness of STTM166b and OEHox32 plants was reduced when compared to that of wild-type plants. Overexpression of miR166b (OE166b) in rice plants or knocking down of OsHox32 by RNA interference (RNAiHox32) led to increased thickness of cell walls and enhanced mechanical strength of culms. Molecular analyses showed that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair regulates cell wall-related gene expression. OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes. The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15). OsHox32 interacts with OSH15, and the START domain of OsHox32, harbouring the miR166b cleavage site, is required for the interaction of these two proteins. Our results demonstrate that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair plays important roles not only in plant growth and development but also in plant architecture by regulating the cell wall-related gene expression.
NA	RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) recruits PRC2-mediated H3K27 tri-methylation on OsCKX4 to regulate lateral branching.	2021	Plant Physiol	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China.	Lateral branches such as shoot and panicle are determining factors and target traits for rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield improvement. Cytokinin promotes rice lateral branching; however, the mechanism underlying the fine-tuning of cytokinin homeostasis in rice branching remains largely unknown. Here, we report the map-based cloning of RLB (RICE LATERAL BRANCH) encoding a nuclear-localized, KNOX-type homeobox protein from a rice cytokinin-deficient mutant showing more tillers, sparser panicles, defected floret morphology as well as attenuated shoot regeneration from callus. RLB directly binds to the promoter and represses the transcription of OsCKX4, a cytokinin oxidase gene with high abundance in panicle branch meristem. OsCKX4 over-expression lines phenocopied rlb which showed up-regulated OsCKX4 levels. Meanwhile, RLB physically binds to Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component OsEMF2b and co-localized with H3K27me3, a suppressing histone modification mediated by PRC2, in the OsCKX4 promoter. We proposed that RLB recruits PRC2 to the OsCKX4 promoter to epigenetically repress its transcription, which suppresses the catabolism of cytokinin, thereby promoting rice lateral branching. Moreover, antisense inhibition of OsCKX4 under the LOG promoter successfully increased panicle size and spikelet number per plant without affecting other major agronomic traits. The current study provides insight into cytokinin homeostasis, lateral branching in plants, and also promising target genes for rice genetic improvement.
