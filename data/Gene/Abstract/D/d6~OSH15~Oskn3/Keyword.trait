D6|OSH15|Oskn3	vegetative	Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis	Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	vegetative	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice	Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	shoot	KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice	We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	meristem	Isolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15	Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	meristem	Isolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15	RNA in situ localization data suggest that OSH15 may play roles in the shoot organization during early embryogenesis and thereafter, OSH15 may be involved in morphogenetic events around the shoot apical meristem
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	dwarf	Loss-of-function mutations in the rice homeobox gene OSH15 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants	Loss-of-function mutations in the rice homeobox gene OSH15 affect the architecture of internodes resulting in dwarf plants
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	panicle	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice	Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	shoot apical meristem	Isolation and characterization of a rice homebox gene, OSH15	Whereas the expression of OSH1 continued within the shoot apical meristem, OSH15 expression within the shoot apical meristem ceased but became observable in a ring shaped pattern at the boundaries of some embryonic organs

D6|OSH15|Oskn3	growth	SUI-family genes encode phosphatidylserine synthases and regulate stem development in rice	Overexpression of SUI1 and SUI2 caused outgrowths of internodes during vegetative development, and we showed that expression patterns of Oryza Sativa Homeobox 15 (OSH15) and Histone4 were impaired
D6|OSH15|Oskn3	branching	Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice	Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
