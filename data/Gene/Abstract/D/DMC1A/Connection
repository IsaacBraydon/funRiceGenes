DMC1A|DMC1	XRCC3	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 In rice, two Dmc1 genes, Dmc1A and Dmc1B, have been reported
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 In the present study, we expressed the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins in bacteria and purified them
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 The strand-exchange activity of the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein was much higher than that of the DMC1B protein
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 Consistently, the DNA-binding activity of the DMC1A protein was higher than that of the DMC1B protein
DMC1A|DMC1	DMC1B	Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.	 These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice
