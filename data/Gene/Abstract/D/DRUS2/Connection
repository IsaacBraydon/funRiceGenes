DRUS2|FLR2	FLR11	Mutations of two FERONIA-like receptor genes enhance rice blast resistance without growth penalty.	 Using these genetic resources, we found that mutations in the FLR2 and FLR11 genes provide resistance to rice blast without a profound growth penalty
DRUS1|FLR1	DRUS2|FLR2	Roles of FERONIA-like receptor genes in regulating grain size and quality in rice	 We found that FLR1, FLR2 and FLR8 negatively regulated grain size, and FLR15 positively regulated grain size
