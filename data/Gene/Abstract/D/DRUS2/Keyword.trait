DRUS2|FLR2	sterile	The Rice Receptor-like Kinases DWARF AND RUNTISH SPIKELET1 and 2 Repress Cell Death and Affect Sugar Utilization in Reproductive Development.	A drus1-1 drus2 double knockout mutant, but not either single mutant, showed extreme dwarfism and barren inflorescences that harbored sterile spikelets
DRUS2|FLR2	tillering	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels
DRUS2|FLR2	development	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development
DRUS2|FLR2	yield	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield
DRUS2|FLR2	yield	Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice	 With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice
