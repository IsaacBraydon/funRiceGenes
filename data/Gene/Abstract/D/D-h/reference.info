Plant height is an important agronomic trait that affects grain yield. Previously, we reported a novel semi-dominant dwarf mutant, HD1, derived from chemical mutagenesis using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) on a japonica rice cultivar, Hwacheong. In this study, we cloned the gene responsible for the dwarf mutant using a map-based approach. Fine mapping revealed that the mutant gene was located on the short arm of chromosome 1 in a 48 kb region. Sequencing of the candidate genes and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) analysis identified the gene, d-h, which encodes a protein of unknown function but whose sequence is conserved in other cereal crops. Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and promoter activity assays showed that the d-h gene was primarily expressed in the nodes and the panicle. In the HD1 plant, the d-h gene was found to carry a 63-bp deletion in the ORF region that was subsequently confirmed by transgenic experiments to be directly responsible for the gain-of-function phenotype observed in the mutant. Since the mutant plants exhibit a defect in GA response, but not in the GA synthetic pathway, it appears that the d-h gene may be involved in a GA signaling pathway.
