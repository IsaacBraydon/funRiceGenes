D-h	dwarf	Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice	Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice
D-h	panicle	Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice	Real-time (RT)-PCR analysis and promoter activity assays showed that the d-h gene was primarily expressed in the nodes and the panicle
D-h	 ga 	Isolation and characterization of a dominant dwarf gene, d-h, in rice	Since the mutant plants exhibit a defect in GA response, but not in the GA synthetic pathway, it appears that the d-h gene may be involved in a GA signaling pathway
