DSH5	DSH5, a dihydrosphingosine C4 hydroxylase gene family member, shows spatially restricted expression in rice and is lethal when expressed ectopically. |  Rice has two types of DSH homologs: general DSHs, namely DSH1, DSH2 and DSH4, and others that show spatial expression profiles, namely DSH3 and DSH5 |  DSH3 and DSH5 showed low-level expression |  DSH5 expression was specifically in vascular bundle tissues |  Ectopic expression of DSH5 induced a dwarf phenotype characterized by severe growth inhibition and an increase in the thickness of the leaf body caused by enlargement of bulliform cells in the leaves
