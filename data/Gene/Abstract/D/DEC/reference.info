The mechanism responsible for this extremely regular pattern is one of the most fascinating enigmas in plant biology. In this study, we identified a gene regulating the phyllotactic pattern in rice. Loss-of-function mutants of the DECUSSATE (DEC) gene displayed a phyllotactic conversion from normal distichous to decussate. The dec mutants had an enlarged SAM with enhanced cell division activity. In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed. These phenotypes indicate that DEC has opposite functions in SAM and RAM. Map-based cloning revealed that DEC encodes a plant-specific protein containing a glutamine-rich region and a conserved motif. Although its molecular function is unclear, the conserved domain is shared with fungi and animals. Expression analysis showed that several type-A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway were downregulated in the dec mutant. In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous CK. Our results suggest that DEC is a factor that controls the phyllotactic pattern by affecting the CK signaling in rice.
