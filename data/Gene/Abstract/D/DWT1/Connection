DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Here, we have used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify OsPIP5K1, a member of the rice phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase family, as a protein that interacts with DWT1
DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Cytological analyses confirmed that DWT1 induces accumulation of OsPIP5K1 and its product PI(4,5)P2 , a phosphoinositide secondary messenger, in nuclear bodies
DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Mutation of OsPIP5K1 compounds the dwarf dwt1 phenotype but abolishes the main shoot dominance
DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Conversely, overexpression of OsPIP5K1 partially rescues dwt1 developmental defects
DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Furthermore, we showed that DWL2, the homolog of DWT1, is also able to interact with OsPIP5K1 and shares partial functional redundancy with DWT1 in controlling rice uniformity
DWT1	OsPIP5K1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Overall, our data suggest that nuclear localized OsPIP5K1 acts with DWT1 and/or DWL2 to coordinate the uniform growth of rice shoots, likely through nuclear phosphoinositide signals, which provides insights into the regulation of rice uniformity via a largely unexplored plant nuclear signaling pathway
DWL2	DWT1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.	 Furthermore, we showed that DWL2, the homolog of DWT1, is also able to interact with OsPIP5K1 and shares partial functional redundancy with DWT1 in controlling rice uniformity
DWL2	DWT1	DWT1/DWL2 act together with OsPIP5K1 to regulate plant uniform growth in rice.
