DWT1	GA	Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice	Moreover, the non-elongating internodes of dwt1 are insensitive to exogenous gibberellin (GA) treatment, and some of the slender rice1 (slr1) dwt1 double mutant exhibits defective internodes similar to the dwt1 single mutant, suggesting that the DWT1 activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with GA signaling.
DWT1	panicle	Dwarf Tiller1, a Wuschel-related homeobox transcription factor, is required for tiller growth in rice	The DWT1 gene is highly expressed in young panicles, but undetectable in the internodes, suggesting that DWT1 expression is spatially or temporally separated from its effect on the internode growth.
