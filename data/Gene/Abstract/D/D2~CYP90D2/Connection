CYP90D3	D2|CYP90D2	Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro	 We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: CYP90D2 and CYP90D3| However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies| These results indicate that CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice|Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro
D11|CPB1|CYP724B1	D2|CYP90D2	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	 Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
D2|CYP90D2	RAVL1	RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice	 Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback
D2|CYP90D2	LPA1	Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) determines lamina joint bending by suppressing auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo brassinosteroids in rice.	 A strong synergic effect is detected between lpa1 and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination
