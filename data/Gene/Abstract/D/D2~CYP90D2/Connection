In conclusion, there is a diverse genetic basis for tiller angle between the two subpopulations, and it is the novel gene TAC3 together with TAC1, D2, and other newly identified genes in this study that controls tiller angle in rice cultivars
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11|OsD2	RAVL1	RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.	 Mutants d61-1 and d2 were less susceptible to sheath blight disease, bri1-D was more susceptible, and ravl1 and d61-1/EIL1 Ri5 were similarly susceptible compared to WT
D2|CYP90D2|SMG11|OsD2	RAVL1	RAVL1 activates brassinosteroids and ethylene signaling to modulate response to sheath blight disease in rice.	 BRI1 and D2 expression in EIL1 Ri5/RAVL1 OX and EIL1 expression in d61-1/RAVL1 OX, indicated that RAVL1 activates BRI1/D2 and EIL1, respectively, independent of BR and ethylene signaling
