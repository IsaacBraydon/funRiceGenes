DRW1	cell cycle	GR5 acts in the G protein pathway to regulate grain size in rice	To identify the downstream effectors of GR5 in grain development, we performed DAP-seq analysis and identified four genes related to grain size and the cell cycle: DEP2 (LOC_Os07g42410), DEP3 (LOC_Os06g46350), DRW1 (LOC_Os09g06560), and CyCD5;2 (LOC_Os12g39830).
