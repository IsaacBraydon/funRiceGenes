NA	GR5 acts in the G protein pathway to regulate grain size in rice.	2023	Plant Commun	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology and Breeding, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Grain size is an important determinant of grain yield in rice. Although dozens of grain size genes have been reported, the molecular mechanisms that control grain size remain to be fully clarified. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GR5 (GRAIN ROUND 5), which is allelic to SMOS1/SHB/RLA1/NGR5 and encodes an AP2 transcription factor. GR5 acts as a transcriptional activator and determines grain size by influencing cell proliferation and expansion. We demonstrated that GR5 physically interacts with five Gγ subunit proteins (RGG1, RGG2, DEP1, GS3, and GGC2) and acts downstream of the G protein complex. Four downstream target genes of GR5 in grain development (DEP2, DEP3, DRW1, and CyCD5;2) were revealed and their core T/CGCAC motif identified by yeast one-hybrid, EMSA, and ChIP-PCR experiments. Our results revealed that GR5 interacts with Gγ subunits and cooperatively determines grain size by regulating the expression of downstream target genes. These findings provide new insight into the genetic regulatory network of the G protein signaling pathway in the control of grain size and provide a potential target for high-yield rice breeding.
