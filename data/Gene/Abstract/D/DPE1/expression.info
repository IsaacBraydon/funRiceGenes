DPE1	 DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules |  Changes in DPE1 gene expression also resulted in modifications in the thermal and pasting features of endosperm starch granules	 DPE1 overexpression decreased amylose content and resulted in small and tightly packed starch granules, whereas DPE1 suppression increased amylose content and formed heterogeneous-sized, spherical, and loosely packed starch granules
DPE1	 Overexpression of DPE1 in pho1 resulted in plump seeds only	 Overexpression of DPE1 in pho1 resulted in plump seeds only
