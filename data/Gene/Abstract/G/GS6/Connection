DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OsBZR1	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING, a new member of the GRAS family, plays positive roles in brassinosteroid signaling in rice	Finally, consistent with the fact that DLT is also negatively feedback-regulated by BR treatment, a gel mobility shift assay showed that OsBZR1 can bind to the DLT promoter through the BR-response element
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	GW5|qSW5	GW5 acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.	 GW5 protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight)

Here, we report that OsOFP19 negatively modulates brassinosteroid (BR) response and integrates it with cell division pattern to affect plant architecture, including grain shape, through interaction with both DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) and OSH1 (Oryza sativa homeobox1)
