The biosynthesis of flavonoids, important secondary plant metabolites, has been investigated extensively, but few mutants of genes in this pathway have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). The rice gold hull and internode (gh) mutants exhibit a reddish-brown pigmentation in the hull and internode and their phenotype has long been used as a morphological marker trait for breeding and genetic study. Here, we characterized that the gh1 mutant was a mutant of the rice chalcone isomerase gene (OsCHI). The result showed that gh1 had a Dasheng retrotransposon inserted in the 5' UTR of the OsCHI gene, which resulted in the complete loss of OsCHI expression. gh1 exhibited golden pigmentation in hulls and internodes once the panicles were exposed to light. The total flavonoid content in gh1 hulls was increased threefold compared to wild type. Consistent with the gh1 phenotype, OsCHI transcripts were expressed in most tissues of rice and most abundantly in internodes. It was also expressed at high levels in panicles before heading, distributed mainly in lemmas and paleae, but its expression decreased substantially after the panicles emerged from the sheath. OsCHI encodes a protein functionally and structurally conserved to chalcone isomerases in other species. Our findings demonstrated that the OsCHI gene was indispensable for flux of the flavonoid pathway in rice.
NA	Screening of rice mutants with improved saccharification efficiency results in the identification of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1.	2017	Planta	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi, 464-8601, Japan. khirano@nuagr1.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp.	The screening of rice mutants with improved cellulose to glucose saccharification efficiency (SE) identifies reduced xylan and/or ferulic acid, and a qualitative change of lignin to impact SE. To ensure the availability of sustainable energy, considerable effort is underway to utilize lignocellulosic plant biomass as feedstock for the production of biofuels. However, the high cost of degrading plant cell wall components to fermentable sugars (saccharification) has been problematic. One way to overcome this barrier is to develop plants possessing cell walls that are amenable to saccharification. In this study, we aimed to identify new molecular factors that influence saccharification efficiency (SE) in rice. By screening 22 rice mutants, we identified two lines, 122 and 108, with improved SE. Reduced xylan and ferulic acid within the cell wall of line 122 were probable reasons of improved SE. Line 108 showed reduced levels of thioglycolic-released lignin; however, the amount of Klason lignin was comparable to the wild-type, indicating that structural changes had occurred in the 108 lignin polymer which resulted in improved SE. Positional cloning revealed that the genes responsible for improved SE in 122 and 108 were rice CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (OsCOP1) and GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE 1 (GH1), respectively, which have not been previously reported to influence SE. The screening of mutants for improved SE is an efficient approach to identify novel genes that affect SE, which is relevant in the development of crops as biofuel sources.
