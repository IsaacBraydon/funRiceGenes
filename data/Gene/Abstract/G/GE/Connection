GE|CYP78A13	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level	GE|CYP78A13	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
