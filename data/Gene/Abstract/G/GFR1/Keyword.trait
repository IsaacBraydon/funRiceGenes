GFR1	grain	Favorable alleles of GRAIN-FILLING RATE 1 increase the grain-filling rate and yield of rice.	 Evaluation of the grain-filling rate and grain yield of F1 plants harboring GFR1Ludao and the alleles of 20 hybrids widely cultivated commercially confirmed that favorable alleles of GFR1 can be used to further improve the grain-filling rate of hybrid japonica rice
