GL3.2	grain growth	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice	Sequence search revealed that CYP78A13 has a paralogue Grain<U+2005>Length 3.2 (GL3.2, LOC_Os03g30420) in rice with distinct expression patterns, analysis of transgenic plants harbouring either CYP78A13 or GL3.2 showed that both can promote grain growth.
