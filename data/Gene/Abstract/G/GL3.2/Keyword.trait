GL3.2	grain growth	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice	Sequence search revealed that CYP78A13 has a paralogue Grain<U+2005>Length 3.2 (GL3.2, LOC_Os03g30420) in rice with distinct expression patterns, analysis of transgenic plants harbouring either CYP78A13 or GL3.2 showed that both can promote grain growth.

GL3.2	growth	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice	Both CYP78A13 and GL3.2 promote seed growth in rice
GL3.2	seed growth	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice	Both CYP78A13 and GL3.2 promote seed growth in rice
GL3.2	grain length	Variations in CYP78A13 coding region influence grain size and yield in rice	It was predicted that CYP78A13 was associated with grain width, while another P450 paralogue located on chromosome 3, LOC_Os03g30420, which we named Grain Length3.2 (GL3.2), was associated with grain length
