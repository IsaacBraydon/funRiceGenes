GF14c	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14c	GF14f	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	In this study, we identified GF14c (a 14-3-3 protein) as an Hd3a-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	In vitro and in vivo experiments, using a combination of pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, confirmed the interaction between Hd3a and GF14c
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
GF14c	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
GF14c	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.
GF14c	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 OsSCL7 can interact with GF14c, a 14-3-3 protein, and loss-of-function GF14c leads to enhanced susceptibility to M
GF14c	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 Additionally, OsSCL7 protein levels were reduced in the gf14c mutant and knocking out OsSCL7 affected the expression of a series of defence-related genes
GF14c	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and GF14c in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein
