GF14c|OsGF14C	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
GF14c|OsGF14C	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
GF14c|OsGF14C	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7|WG3	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7|WG3	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 OsSCL7 can interact with GF14c, a 14-3-3 protein, and loss-of-function GF14c leads to enhanced susceptibility to M
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7|WG3	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 Additionally, OsSCL7 protein levels were reduced in the gf14c mutant and knocking out OsSCL7 affected the expression of a series of defence-related genes
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsGRAS19|OsSCL7|WG3	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c positively regulates immunity by modulating the protein homoeostasis of the GRAS protein OsSCL7 in rice.	 Taken together, these findings uncover the important roles of OsSCL7 and GF14c in plant immunity and a potential mechanism by which plants fine-tune immunity by regulating the protein stability of a GRAS protein via a 14-3-3 protein
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsMsr9|OsFBX257	Stress-induced F-Box protein-coding gene OsFBX257 modulates drought stress adaptations and ABA responses in rice.	 Conserved amongÂ land plants, OsFBX257 is a component of the SCF complex, can form homomers and interact molecularly with the 14-3-3 rice proteins GF14b and GF14c
GF14c|OsGF14C	GF14f|OsGF14f	Overexpression of OsGF14C enhances salinity tolerance but reduces blast resistance in rice.	 The enhanced salinity tolerance is related to the reduction of methylglyoxal and Na(+) uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation and the negative role of OsGF14C in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of OsGF14E, OsGF14F and PR genes
GF14c|OsGF14C	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	Overexpression of OsGF14C enhances salinity tolerance but reduces blast resistance in rice.
