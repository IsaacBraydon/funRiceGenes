GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	In this study, we identified GF14c (a 14-3-3 protein) as an Hd3a-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	In vitro and in vivo experiments, using a combination of pull-down assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, confirmed the interaction between Hd3a and GF14c
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
GF14c	Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
