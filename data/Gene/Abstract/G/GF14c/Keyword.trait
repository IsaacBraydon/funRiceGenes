GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	Functional analysis using either GF14c overexpression or knockout transgenic rice plants indicated that this interaction plays a role in the regulation of flowering
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	GF14c-overexpressing plants exhibited a delay in flowering and the knockout mutants displayed early flowering relative to the wild-type plants under short-day conditions
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	These results suggest that GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering by interacting with Hd3a
GF14c	flower	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a	The 14-3-3 protein GF14c acts as a negative regulator of flowering in rice by interacting with the florigen Hd3a
GF14c	drought	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
GF14c	seedling	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
GF14c	drought tolerance	Sugar starvation- and GA-inducible calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 feedback regulates GA biosynthesis and activates a 14-3-3 protein to confer drought tolerance in rice seedlings	Overexpression of either constitutively active OsCDPK1 or GF14c enhanced drought tolerance in transgenic rice seedlings
