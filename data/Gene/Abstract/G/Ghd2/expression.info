Symbol	Expression	Overexpression
Ghd2	 Overexpression of Ghd2 resulted in significantly reduced drought resistance, while its knockout mutant showed the opposite phenotype |  Several SAGs were confirmed to be regulated by Ghd2 using a transient expression system in rice protoplasts |  OsARID3 and OsPURÎ± showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions	 Overexpression of Ghd2 resulted in significantly reduced drought resistance, while its knockout mutant showed the opposite phenotype
