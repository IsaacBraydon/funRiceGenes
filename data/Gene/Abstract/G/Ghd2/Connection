Ghd2|OsK	Ghd7	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	 Here, we found that a CO-like gene, Ghd2 (Grain number, plant height, and heading date2), which can increase the yield potential under normal growth condition just like its homologue Ghd7, is involved in the regulation of leaf senescence and drought resistance
Ghd2|OsK	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	 Ghd2 interacted with several regulatory proteins, including OsARID3, OsPURα, and three 14-3-3 proteins
Ghd2|OsK	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	 OsARID3 and OsPURα showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions
