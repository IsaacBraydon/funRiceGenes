Ghd2|OsK	Ghd7	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	Here, we found that a CO-like gene, Ghd2 (Grain number, plant height, and heading date2), which can increase the yield potential under normal growth condition just like its homologue Ghd7, is involved in the regulation of leaf senescence and drought resistance
Ghd2|OsK	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	Ghd2 interacted with several regulatory proteins, including OsARID3, OsPURα, and three 14-3-3 proteins
Ghd2|OsK	OsARID3	Ghd2, a CONSTANS-like gene, confers drought sensitivity through regulation of senescence in rice.	OsARID3 and OsPURα showed expression patterns similar to Ghd2 in rice leaves, with the highest levels at the grain-filling stage, whereas OsARID3 and the 14-3-3 genes responded differently to drought stress conditions
Ghd2|OsK	OsDCL3a	Translational repression by a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element in the 3' untranslated region.	 Interestingly, the translational repression of Ghd2 by the sMITE mainly relies on Dicer-like 3a (OsDCL3a)
Ehd1	Ghd2|OsK	The CCT transcriptional activator Ghd2 constantly delays the heading date by upregulating CO3 in rice.	 A comparison of the heading dates among plants with CO3 knocked out or overexpressed and double mutants overexpressing Ghd2 with CO3 knocked out shows that CO3 negatively and constantly regulates flowering by repressing the transcription of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
Ghd2|OsK	Hd3a	The CCT transcriptional activator Ghd2 constantly delays the heading date by upregulating CO3 in rice.	 A comparison of the heading dates among plants with CO3 knocked out or overexpressed and double mutants overexpressing Ghd2 with CO3 knocked out shows that CO3 negatively and constantly regulates flowering by repressing the transcription of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
Ghd2|OsK	RFT1	The CCT transcriptional activator Ghd2 constantly delays the heading date by upregulating CO3 in rice.	 A comparison of the heading dates among plants with CO3 knocked out or overexpressed and double mutants overexpressing Ghd2 with CO3 knocked out shows that CO3 negatively and constantly regulates flowering by repressing the transcription of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1
