GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsYUCCA5	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	 Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 In this study, we show that a WOX3 gene, LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1 (LSY1), regulates lateral leaf development in a different manner than that of other duplicated paralogs of WOX3, NARROW LEAF2 (NAL2)/NAL3, in rice
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 Our results indicated that all of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged
