GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsYUCCA5	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	 Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 In this study, we show that a WOX3 gene, LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1 (LSY1), regulates lateral leaf development in a different manner than that of other duplicated paralogs of WOX3, NARROW LEAF2 (NAL2)/NAL3, in rice
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	NAL2|OsWOX3A|WOX3	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 Our results indicated that all of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes	 Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsSPL10	Rice SPL10 positively regulates trichome development through expression of HL6 and auxin-related genes 	 Tests of allelism in 51 glabrous rice (Oryza sativa) accessions collected worldwide identified OsSPL10 and OsWOX3B as regulators of trichome development in rice
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	OsTCL1	Ectopic expression of R3 MYB transcription factor gene OsTCL1 in Arabidopsis, but not rice, affects trichome and root hair formation.	 Consistent with these observations, expression levels of GL2, R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene GLABRA1 (GL1) and several R3 MYB genes were greatly reduced, indicating that OsTCL1 is functional R3 MYB
