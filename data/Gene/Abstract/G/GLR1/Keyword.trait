GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	breeding	Glabrous Rice 1, encoding a homeodomain protein, regulates trichome development in rice	CONCLUSION: GLR1 plays an important role in rice trichome development and will contribute to breeding of glabrous elite rice varieties
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	leaf	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.

GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	leaf	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 A loss-of-function mutant of LSY1 exhibited an asymmetrical defect from early leaf development, which is different from a symmetric defect in a double loss-of-function mutant of NAL2/3, whereas the expression of both genes was observed in a similar domain in the margins of leaf primordia
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	leaf	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 Expression domains and the level of adaxial/abaxial marker genes were affected in the LSY1 overexpressing plants, indicating that LSY1 is involved in regulation of adaxial/abaxial patterning at the margins of the leaf primordia
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	leaf	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 Additive phenotypes in some leaf traits of lsy1 nal2/3 triple mutants and the unchanged level of NAL2/3 expression in the lsy1 background suggested that LSY1 regulates lateral leaf development independently of NAL2/3
GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	leaf	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	 Our results indicated that all of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged
