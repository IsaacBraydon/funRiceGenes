GLR1|OsWOX3B|GL1|LSY1	 A loss-of-function mutant of LSY1 exhibited an asymmetrical defect from early leaf development, which is different from a symmetric defect in a double loss-of-function mutant of NAL2/3, whereas the expression of both genes was observed in a similar domain in the margins of leaf primordia |  Unlike NAL2/3, overexpression of LSY1 produced malformed leaves whose margins were curled adaxially |  Expression domains and the level of adaxial/abaxial marker genes were affected in the LSY1 overexpressing plants, indicating that LSY1 is involved in regulation of adaxial/abaxial patterning at the margins of the leaf primordia |  Additive phenotypes in some leaf traits of lsy1 nal2/3 triple mutants and the unchanged level of NAL2/3 expression in the lsy1 background suggested that LSY1 regulates lateral leaf development independently of NAL2/3	 Unlike NAL2/3, overexpression of LSY1 produced malformed leaves whose margins were curled adaxially
