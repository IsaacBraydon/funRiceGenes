BACKGROUND: Glabrous rice, which lacks trichomes on the rice epidermis, is regarded as an important germplasm resource in rice breeding. Trichomes are derived from aerial epidermal cells and used as a model to study the cell fate determination in plant. In Arabidopsis, the molecular mechanisms of trichome development have been well studied. However, little is known about the molecular basis of trichome development in rice. RESULTS: In this study, near isogenic lines harboring the glabrous rice 1 locus were developed. By a map-based approach, we narrowed down the locus to a 21-kb DNA region harboring two genes. One of the genes named Glabrous Rice 1 (GLR1), which is most likely the candidate, encodes a homeodomain protein containing the WOX motif. Constitutive Expression of GLR1 could partially complement the glabrous phenotype of NILglr1. The knock down of GLR1 by RNA interference led to a significant decrease in trichome number on the leaves and glumes of the RNAi transgenic plants. CONCLUSION: GLR1 plays an important role in rice trichome development and will contribute to breeding of glabrous elite rice varieties.
NA	Hairy Leaf 6, an AP2/ERF transcription factor, interacts with OsWOX3B and regulates trichome formation in rice.	2017	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Wuhan 430070, China; College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Trichome formation has been extensively studied as a mechanistic model for epidermal cell differentiation and cell morphogenesis in plants. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying trichome formation (i.e. initiation and elongation) in rice remain largely unknown. Here, we report an AP2/ERF transcription factor, Hairy Leaf 6 (HL6), which controls trichome formation in rice. Functional characterization of HL6 revealed that HL6 transcriptionally regulates trichome elongation in rice. Furthermore, the regulation of HL6 in trichome elongation is dependent on functional OsWOX3B, which encodes a homeodomain-containing protein that acts as a key regulator in trichome initiation. Using yeast two-hybrid assays and bimolecular fluorescence complementation tests, we determined that HL6 interacts with OsWOX3B to regulate trichome formation and form a protein complex, enhancing the binding ability of HL6 with the auxin-related gene OsYUCCA5. Population genetic analysis indicated that HL6 was under negative selection during rice domestication. Our findings provide new insights in the molecular network of HL6 and OsWOX3B involved in the auxin-mediated pathway that regulates trichome formation in rice.
NA	LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1, a member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX3 gene family, regulates lateral outgrowth of leaves in rice.	2017	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	In several eudicot species, one copy of each member of the WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) gene family, WOX1 and WOX3, are redundantly or differentially involved in lateral leaf outgrowth, whereas only WOX3 gene regulating the lateral domain of leaf development has been reported in grass. In this study, we show that a WOX3 gene, LEAF LATERAL SYMMETRY1 (LSY1), regulates lateral leaf development in a different manner than that of other duplicated paralogs of WOX3, NARROW LEAF2 (NAL2)/NAL3, in rice. A loss-of-function mutant of LSY1 exhibited an asymmetrical defect from early leaf development, which is different from a symmetric defect in a double loss-of-function mutant of NAL2/3, whereas the expression of both genes was observed in a similar domain in the margins of leaf primordia. Unlike NAL2/3, overexpression of LSY1 produced malformed leaves whose margins were curled adaxially. Expression domains and the level of adaxial/abaxial marker genes were affected in the LSY1 overexpressing plants, indicating that LSY1 is involved in regulation of adaxial/abaxial patterning at the margins of the leaf primordia. Additive phenotypes in some leaf traits of lsy1 nal2/3 triple mutants and the unchanged level of NAL2/3 expression in the lsy1 background suggested that LSY1 regulates lateral leaf development independently of NAL2/3. Our results indicated that all of the rice WOX3 genes are involved in leaf lateral outgrowth, but the functions of LSY1 and NAL2/3 have diverged. We propose that the function of WOX3 and the regulatory mode of leaf development in rice is comparable to WOX1/WOX3 in eudicot species.
