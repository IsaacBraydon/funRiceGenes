GCN5	submergence	SUB1A-1 anchors a regulatory cascade for epigenetic and transcriptional controls of submergence tolerance in rice.	 ADA2b and GCN5 expression was induced under submergence, suggesting that these two genes might play roles in response to submergence stress

GCN5	acetyltransferase	SUB1A-1 anchors a regulatory cascade for epigenetic and transcriptional controls of submergence tolerance in rice.	 Here, we show that SUB1A-1, but not SUB1A-2, interacts with ADA2b of the ADA2b-GCN5 acetyltransferase complex, in which GCN5 functions as a histone acetyltransferase
