GCN5	 ADA2b and GCN5 expression was induced under submergence, suggesting that these two genes might play roles in response to submergence stress |  Taken together, these results suggest that phospho-SUB1A-1 recruits the ADA2-GCN5 acetyltransferase complex to modify the chromatin structure of the ERF66/ERF67 promoter regions and activate gene expression, which in turn enhances rice submergence tolerance
