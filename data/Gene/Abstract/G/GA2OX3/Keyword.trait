GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	GA inactivation	Brassinosteroid regulates cell elongation by modulating gibberellin metabolism in rice	When excessive active BR is applied, the hormone mostly induces GA inactivation through upregulation of the GA inactivation gene GA2ox-3 and also represses BR biosynthesis, resulting in decreased hormone levels and growth inhibition.
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	root	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	 Mutation in OsGA2ox3 weakened ethylene-induced GA inactivation and reduced the ethylene sensitivity of the root
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	ethylene	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	 Mutation in OsGA2ox3 weakened ethylene-induced GA inactivation and reduced the ethylene sensitivity of the root
