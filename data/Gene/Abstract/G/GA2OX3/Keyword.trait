GA2OX3	GA inactivation	Brassinosteroid regulates cell elongation by modulating gibberellin metabolism in rice	When excessive active BR is applied, the hormone mostly induces GA inactivation through upregulation of the GA inactivation gene GA2ox-3 and also represses BR biosynthesis, resulting in decreased hormone levels and growth inhibition.
