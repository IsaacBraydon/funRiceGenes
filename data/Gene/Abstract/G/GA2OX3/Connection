GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsMADS57	Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.	 Expectedly, the transcript levels of OsGA2ox3, encoding GAs deactivated enzyme, were significantly enhanced in OsMADS57 knockdown plants
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsMADS57	Rice transcription factor OsMADS57 regulates plant height by modulating gibberellin catabolism.	 More importantly, dual-luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that OsMADS57 directly regulates the transcription of OsGA2ox3 as well as EUI1 through binding to the CArG-box motifs in their promoter regions
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsNAC109	OsNAC109 regulates senescence, growth and development by altering the expression of and phytohormone-associated genes in rice.	 It was confirmed that OsNAC109 could directly regulate the expression of OsNAP, OsNYC3, OsEATB, OsAMTR1, OsZFP185, OsMPS and OsGA2ox3 by targeting to the highly conserved cis-element CNTCSSNNSCAVG except OsSAMS1
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	OsGA2ox1	Orchestration of ethylene and gibberellin signals determines primary root elongation in rice.	 Further investigations unraveled that ethylene signaling transcription factor ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE 1 OsEIL1 activates the expression of the GA metabolism genes GIBBERELLIN 2-OXIDASE 2 (OsGA2ox1), OsGA2ox2, OsGA2ox3, and OsGA2ox5, thereby deactivating GA activity, inhibiting cell proliferation in the root meristem, and ultimately gradually inhibiting primary root growth

GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	GA2ox7	Jasmonate-mediated gibberellin catabolism constrains growth during herbivore attack in rice.	 BPH infestation also increases inactive gibberellin (GA) levels and transcripts of GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) genes, two (GA2ox3 and GA2ox7) of which encode enzymes that catalyze the conversion of bioactive GAs to inactive GAs in vitro and in vivo
