GH1	phosphatase	A SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase controls rice development via hydrolyzing PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.	A SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase controls rice development via hydrolyzing PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.
GH1	development	A SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase controls rice development via hydrolyzing PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.	A SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase controls rice development via hydrolyzing PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.
GH1	grain number	A SAC phosphoinositide phosphatase controls rice development via hydrolyzing PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.	Here, we identified the role of GRAIN NUMBER AND PLANT HEIGHT1 (GH1), which encodes a suppressor of actin (SAC) domain-containing phosphatase with unknown function in rice (Oryza sativa).
