GS5	grain width	Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice	 We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight
GS5	grain size	Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice	 We showed that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) GS5 in rice controls grain size by regulating grain width, filling and weight| GS5 encodes a putative serine carboxypeptidase and functions as a positive regulator of grain size, such that higher expression of GS5 is correlated with larger grain size| The results suggest that natural variation in GS5 contributes to grain size diversity in rice and may be useful in improving yield in rice and, potentially, other crops(2)|Natural variation in GS5 plays an important role in regulating grain size and yield in rice
