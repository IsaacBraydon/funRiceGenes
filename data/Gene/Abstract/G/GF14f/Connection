GF14b|OsGF14b	GF14f|OsGF14f	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14c|OsGF14C	GF14f|OsGF14f	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsFD2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that GF14f directly interacts with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, OsFD2
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsCEN2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 In in vivo and in vitro experiments, OsCEN2 physically interacted with a G-box factor 14-3-3 homolog, GF14f, which negatively regulates grain size
GF14c|OsGF14C	GF14f|OsGF14f	Overexpression of OsGF14C enhances salinity tolerance but reduces blast resistance in rice.	 The enhanced salinity tolerance is related to the reduction of methylglyoxal and Na(+) uptake instead of exclusion or compartmentation and the negative role of OsGF14C in blast resistance is associated with the suppression of OsGF14E, OsGF14F and PR genes
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsbZIP23	The 14-3-3 protein OsGF14f interacts with OsbZIP23 and enhances its activity to confer osmotic stress tolerance in rice.	The 14-3-3 protein OsGF14f interacts with OsbZIP23 and enhances its activity to confer osmotic stress tolerance in rice.
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsbZIP23	The 14-3-3 protein OsGF14f interacts with OsbZIP23 and enhances its activity to confer osmotic stress tolerance in rice.	 Furthermore, OsGF14f positively regulates abscisic acid (ABA) responses by interacting with the core ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP23 (BASIC LEUCINE ZIPPER 23) to enhance its transcriptional regulation activity toward downstream target genes
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsbZIP23	The 14-3-3 protein OsGF14f interacts with OsbZIP23 and enhances its activity to confer osmotic stress tolerance in rice.	 Further genetic analysis showed that OsGF14f is required for the full function of OsbZIP23 in rice osmotic response and OsGF14f-mediated osmotic stress tolerance partially depends on OsbZIP23
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsbZIP23	The 14-3-3 protein OsGF14f interacts with OsbZIP23 and enhances its activity to confer osmotic stress tolerance in rice.	 Interestingly, OsGF14f is a direct target gene of OsbZIP23
