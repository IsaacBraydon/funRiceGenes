GF14b|OsGF14b	GF14f|OsGF14f	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsGF14e|GF14e|GID2	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14c|OsGF14C	GF14f|OsGF14f	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsFD2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that GF14f directly interacts with the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, OsFD2
GF14f|OsGF14f	OsCEN2	Florigen repression complexes involving rice CENTRORADIALIS2 regulate grain size.	 In in vivo and in vitro experiments, OsCEN2 physically interacted with a G-box factor 14-3-3 homolog, GF14f, which negatively regulates grain size
