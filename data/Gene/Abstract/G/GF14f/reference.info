Chen F-DNA Research 2006 .pdf	The rice 14-3-3 gene family and its involvement in responses to biotic and abiotic stress	2006	DNA Res	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, The Chinese Academy of Sciences 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	14-3-3 proteins function as major regulators of primary metabolism and cellular signal transduction in plants. However, their involvement in plant defense and stress responses is largely unknown. In order to better address functions of the rice 14-3-3/GF14 proteins in defense and abiotic stress responses, we examined the rice GF14 family that comprises eight numbers. The phylogenetic comparison with the Arabidopsis 14-3-3 family revealed that the majority of rice GF14s might have evolved as an independent branch. At least four rice GF14 genes, GF14b, GF14c, GF14e and Gf14f were differentially regulated in the interactions of rice-Magnaporthe grisea and rice-Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, and the incompatible interactions stronger induced the genes than the compatible interactions. These GF14 genes were also induced by the defense compounds, benzothiadiazole, methyl jasmonate, ethephon and hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, they were differentially regulated by salinity, drought, wounding and abscisic acid. Tissue-specific analysis and expression of GF14-YFP fusions revealed that the four GF14 isoforms were expressed with tissue specificity and accumulated differentially in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our current study provides fundamental information for the further investigation of the rice GF14 proteins.
NA	The 14-3-3 protein GF14f negatively affects grain filling of inferior spikelets of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Plant J	College of Life Science, Fujian Agricultural&amp; Forestry University, Fuzhou, 350002, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), later-flowering inferior spikelets (IS), which are located on proximal secondary branches, fill slowly and produce smaller and lighter grains than earlier-flowering superior spikelets (SS). Many genes have been reported to be involved in poor grain filling of IS; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The present study determined that GF14f, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, showed temporal and spatial differences in expression patterns between SS and IS. Using GF14f-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in GF14f expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield. Furthermore, pull-down assays indicated that GF14f interacts with enzymes that are involved in sucrose breakdown, starch synthesis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis. At the same time, an increase in the activity of sucrose synthase (SuSase), adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), and starch synthase (StSase) was observed in the GF14f-RNAi grains. Comprehensive analysis of the proteome and metabolite profiling revealed that the abundance of proteins related to the TCA cycle, and glycolysis increased in the GF14f-RNAi grains together with several carbohydrate intermediates. These results suggest that GF14f negatively affects grain development and filling, and the observed higher abundance of the GF14f protein in IS compared to SS may be responsible for poor IS grain filling. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying poor grain filling of IS and suggests that GF14f could serve as a potential tool for improving rice grain filling.

NA	Overexpression of OsGF14f Enhances Quantitative Leaf Blast and Bacterial Blight Resistance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China.	Although it is known that rice 14-3-3 family genes are involved in various defense responses, the functions of OsGF14f in response to diseases have not been reported. Here, we showed that the transcription of OsGF14f was significantly induced by leaf blast infection, and the overexpression of OsGF14f quantitatively enhanced resistance to leaf blast and bacterial blight in rice. Further analysis showed that the expression levels of salicylic acid (SA) pathway-associated genes (PAL1, NH1, PR1a and PR10) in the OsGF14f-overexpressing plants, were higher than those in wild-type plants after inoculation with the blast isolate (Magnaporthe oryzae Barr). In addition, the expression level of OsGF14f was significantly induced after SA treatment, and higher endogenous SA levels were observed in the OsGF14f-overexpressing plants compared with that in wild-type plants, especially after blast challenge. Taken together, these results suggest that OsGF14f positively regulates leaf blast and bacterial blight resistance in rice via the SA-dependent signaling pathway.
NA	GF14f gene is negatively associated with yield and grain chalkiness under rice ratooning.	2023	Front Plant Sci	Tsinghua-Peking Joint Center for Life Sciences, and MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.	BACKGROUND: Ratoon rice cropping has been shown to provide new insights into overcoming the current challenges of rice production in southern China. However, the potential mechanisms impacting yield and grain quality under rice ratooning remain unclear. METHODS: In this study, changes in yield performance and distinct improvements in grain chalkiness in ratoon rice were thoroughly investigated, using physiological, molecular and transcriptomic analysis. RESULTS: Rice ratooning induced an extensive carbon reserve remobilization in combination with an impact on grain filling, starch biosynthesis, and ultimately, an optimization in starch composition and structure in the endosperm. Furthermore, these variations were shown to be associated with a protein-coding gene: GF14f (encoding GF14f isoform of 14-3-3 proteins) and such gene negatively impacts oxidative and environmental resistance in ratoon rice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that this genetic regulation by GF14f gene was the main cause leading to changes in rice yield and grain chalkiness improvement of ratoon rice, irrespective of seasonal or environmental effects. A further significance was to see how yield performance and grain quality of ratoon rice were able to be achieved at higher levels via suppression of GF14f.
