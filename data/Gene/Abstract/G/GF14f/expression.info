GF14f	 The present study determined that GF14f, a member of the 14-3-3 protein family, showed temporal and spatial differences in expression patterns between SS and IS |  Using GF14f-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in GF14f expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield	 Using GF14f-RNAi plants, we observed that a reduction in GF14f expression in the endosperm resulted in a significant increase in both grain length and weight, which in turn improved grain yield |  At the same time, an increase in the activity of sucrose synthase (SuSase), adenosine diphosphate-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), and starch synthase (StSase) was observed in the GF14f-RNAi grains |  Comprehensive analysis of the proteome and metabolite profiling revealed that the abundance of proteins related to the TCA cycle, and glycolysis increased in the GF14f-RNAi grains together with several carbohydrate intermediates
