GSD1	grain setting	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance
GSD1	photoassimilate translocation	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance	Together, our results suggest that GSD1 may play a role in regulating photoassimilate translocation through the symplastic pathway to impact grain setting in rice.
GSD1	plasma membrane	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance	GSD1 was found to be specifically expressed in the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata (PD) of phloem companion cells.
GSD1	grain filling	Grain setting defect 1, encoding a remorin protein, affects the grain setting in rice through regulating plasmodesmatal conductance	Experimental evidence suggests the phenotype of the gsd1-D mutant is caused by defects in the grain filling process as a result of the impaired transport of carbohydrates from the photosynthetic site to the phloem.
