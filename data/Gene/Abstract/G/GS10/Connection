GS10	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	Armadillo repeat only protein GS10 negatively regulates brassinosteroid signaling to control rice grain size.	 Functional analysis reveals that GS10 interacts with TUD1 (Taihu Dwarf1) and is epistatic to OsGSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2) through regulating grain shape and lamina joint inclination, indicating it is negatively involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling
GS10	GW5|qSW5	Armadillo repeat only protein GS10 negatively regulates brassinosteroid signaling to control rice grain size.	 Pyramiding gs10 and the grain size gene GW5 into cultivar GLA4 substantially improved grain shape and appearance quality
GS10	TUD1|DSG1|ELF1	Armadillo repeat only protein GS10 negatively regulates brassinosteroid signaling to control rice grain size.	 Functional analysis reveals that GS10 interacts with TUD1 (Taihu Dwarf1) and is epistatic to OsGSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2) through regulating grain shape and lamina joint inclination, indicating it is negatively involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling
