GSW3	 The insertion of a 232-bp fragment of the genomic sequence in the wild rice, a natural allelic variant gene (GSW3), increased expression levels and reduced grain length and width and 1000-grain weight |  Introducing GSW3Huaye3 into cultivated rice line KJ01 and overexpressing GSW3Huaye3 in Huaye 3 resulted in reduced grain length and width and 1000-grain weight, and grain size and 1000-grain weight changes were closely related to GSW3 expression levels
