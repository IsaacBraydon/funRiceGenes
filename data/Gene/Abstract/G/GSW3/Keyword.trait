GSW3	growth	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 GSW3 regulated grain length and width simultaneously by promoting grain glume cell division and longitudinal and transverse cell growth
GSW3	growth	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 GSW3 was also involved in regulating the gibberellic acid signaling pathway and negatively regulated plant growth
GSW3	grain	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 Knockout of GSW3 in the wild rice inbred line Huaye 3 increased grain length and width and 1000-grain weight
GSW3	grain	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 Introducing GSW3Huaye3 into cultivated rice line KJ01 and overexpressing GSW3Huaye3 in Huaye 3 resulted in reduced grain length and width and 1000-grain weight, and grain size and 1000-grain weight changes were closely related to GSW3 expression levels
GSW3	grain	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 GSW3 regulated grain length and width simultaneously by promoting grain glume cell division and longitudinal and transverse cell growth
GSW3	grain	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 Furthermore, a critical SNP in the GSW3 coding region was obviously correlated with grain size variation in a core collection of cultivated rice
GSW3	grain	Natural Allelic Variation in GRAIN SIZE AND WEIGHT 3 of Wild Rice Regulates the Grain Size and Weight.	 Our study shows that GSW3 negatively regulates grain shape, which could explain different grain shapes in modern cultivars and wild rice
