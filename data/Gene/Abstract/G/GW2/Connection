BLS1|BSG1	GW2	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	 The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
GE|CYP78A13	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level	GE|CYP78A13	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
GIF1|OsCIN2	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
 Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3	GIF1|OsCIN2	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
GS3	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
