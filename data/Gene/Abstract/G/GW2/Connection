BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	GW2	Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice	The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
GIF1|OsCIN2|OsGIF1	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
GIF1|OsCIN2|OsGIF1	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
GW2	GW5|qSW5	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
GW2	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
