GW2	 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level |  The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3 |  Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3	 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
