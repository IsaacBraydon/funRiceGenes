GW2	 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level |  The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3 |  Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3	 To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
GW2|OsGW2	 In this study, we report that reduced expression of OsGW2 can alter grain size, even though natural sequence variation is not responsible for increased grain size in indica rice genotypes |  OsGW2 shows high expression in seed development stages and the protein localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm	 Downregulation of OsGW2 by RNAi technology results in wider and heavier grains |  Using transcriptome analysis, upregulated genes related to grain size regulation have been identified among 1,426 differentially expressed genes in an OsGW2_RNAi transgenic line
