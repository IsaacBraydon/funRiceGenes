Grain shape and size both determine grain weight and therefore crop yield. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling grain shape and size are still largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly. Starch granules were also irregularly packaged in the bsg1 grains. Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size. Map-based cloning revealed that BSG1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein, TRIANGULAR HULL 1, of unknown function. Quantitative PCR and GUS fusion reporter assays showed that BSG1 was expressed mainly in the young panicle and elongating stem. The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice. Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull.
200919164749404395.pdf	A QTL for rice grain width and weight encodes a previously unknown RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase	2007	Nat Genet	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institute for Biological Sciences, The Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	Grain weight is one of the most important components of grain yield and is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in crops. However, the molecular roles of QTLs in the regulation of grain weight have not been fully elucidated. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of GW2, a new QTL that controls rice grain width and weight. Our data show that GW2 encodes a previously unknown RING-type protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is known to function in the degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Loss of GW2 function increased cell numbers, resulting in a larger (wider) spikelet hull, and it accelerated the grain milk filling rate, resulting in enhanced grain width, weight and yield. Our results suggest that GW2 negatively regulates cell division by targeting its substrate(s) to proteasomes for regulated proteolysis. The functional characterization of GW2 provides insight into the mechanism of seed development and is a potential tool for improving grain yield in crops.
NA	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	2011	Theor Appl Genet	State Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Disease Control, Institute of Crop and Nuclear Technology Utilization, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 198 Shiqiao Road, Hangzhou, 310021, People's Republic of China.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far. However, the relationship among these four genes is still unclear, which will impede the process of gene pyramiding breeding program to some extent. To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level. The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3. Meanwhile, qSW5 can be down-regulated by repression of GW2 transcription. Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3. Moreover, the allelic effects of qSW5 and GS3 were detailedly characterized based on a natural population consisting of 180 rice cultivars. It was indicated that mutual interactions exist between the two genes, in which, qSW5 affecting seed length is masked by GS3 alleles, and GS3 affecting seed width is masked by qSW5 alleles. These findings provide more insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying seed size development in rice and are likely to be useful for improving rice grain yield.
NA	Grain width 2 (GW2) and its interacting proteins regulate seed development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Bot Stud	Department of Plant Science, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Gwanakro 200, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 151-921, South Korea.	Seed size has been extensively studied in crop plants, as it determines crop yield. However, the mechanism of seed development remains elusive. In this study, we explored the mechanism of seed development in rice (Oryza sativa L.), and identified proteins affecting seed size.Proteomic analysis showed that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitinase 14 (CHT14), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) accumulated to high levels in the seeds of the natural japonica rice mutant Oochikara, which carries a loss-of-function mutation in the grain width 2 (GW2) gene; GW2 encodes a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase. In vitro pull-down and ubiquitination assays showed that CHT14 and PGK directly interacted with GW2 but were not ubiquitinated by GW2. Immunoblot analysis revealed that protein disulfide isomerase-like 1-1 accumulated to high levels in young developing seeds of the gw2 mutant compared with the wild type. Histochemical ¦Â-glucuronidase staining showed strong expression of GW2 in leaf and root tissues but weak expression in leaf sheaths and internodes. In addition, transformation of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of the GW2 promoter in rice revealed GFP expression in the aleurone layer of seeds.Collectively, these results suggest that GW2 regulates seed size through direct interactions with proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism by modulating their activity or stability and controlling disulfide bond formation in various proteins during seed development. Additionally, GW2 participates in vegetative as well as reproductive growth, and protects the seed from pathogen attack.
NA	Identification of Rice Large Grain Gene GW2 by Whole-Genome Sequencing of a Large Grain-Isogenic Line Integrated with Japonica Native Gene and Its Linkage Relationship with the Co-integrated Semidwarf Gene d60 on Chromosome 2.	2019	Int J Mol Sci	Research Institute of Green Science and Technology, Shizuoka University, 836 Ohya, Suruga-ku, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka 422-8529, Japan. tomita.motonori@shizuoka.ac.jp.	Genetic analysis of &quot;InochinoIchi,&quot; an exceptionally large grain rice variety, was conducted through five continuous backcrosses with Koshihikari as a recurrent parent using the large grain F3 plant in Koshihikari ¡Á Inochinoichi as a nonrecurrent parent. Thorough the F2 and all BCnF2 generations, large, medium, and small grain segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio, indicating that the large grain is controlled by a single allele. Mapping by using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers with small grain homozygous segregants in the F2 of Nipponbare ¡Á Inochinoichi, revealed linkage with around 7.7 Mb markers from the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 2. Whole-genome sequencing on a large grain isogenic Koshihikari (BC4F2) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) identified a single nucleotide deletion in GW2 gene, which is located 8.1 Mb from the end of chromosome 2, encoding a RING protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The GW2-integrated isogenic Koshihikari showed a 34% increase in thousand kernel weight compared to Koshihikari, while retaining a taste score of 80. We further developed a large grain/semi-dwarf isogenic Koshihikari integrated with GW2 and the semidwarfing gene d60, which was found to be localized on chromosome 2. The combined genotype secured high yielding while providing robustness to withstand climate change, which can contribute to the New Green Revolution.
NA	A RING-Type E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, OsGW2, Controls Chlorophyll Content and Dark-Induced Senescence in Rice.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Agronomy, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea.	Leaf senescence is the final stage of plant development. Many internal and external factors affect the senescence process in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we identified qCC2, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for chlorophyll content using a population derived from an interspecific cross between O. sativa (cv. Hwaseong) and Oryza grandiglumis. The O. grandiglumis allele at qCC2 increased chlorophyll content and delayed senescence. GW2 encoding E3 ubiquitin ligase in the qCC2 region was selected as a candidate for qCC2. To determine if GW2 is allelic to qCC2, a gw2-knockout mutant (gw2-ko) was examined using a dark-induced senescence assay. gw2-ko showed delayed leaf senescence in the dark with down-regulated expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and chlorophyll degradation genes (CDGs). The association of the GW2 genotype with the delayed senescence phenotype was confirmed in an F2 population. RNA-seq analysis was conducted to investigate 30-day-old leaf transcriptome dynamics in Hwaseong and a backcross inbred line-CR2002-under dark treatment. This resulted in the identification of genes involved in phytohormone signaling and associated with senescence. These results suggested that transcriptional regulation was associated with delayed senescence in CR2002, and RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase GW2 was a positive regulator of leaf senescence in rice.
NA	gw2 mutation increases grain width and culm thickness in rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Breed Sci	Faculty of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Fukui Prefectural University, 4-1-1 Kenjojima, Matsuoka, Eiheiji-cho, Yoshida-gun, Fukui 910-1195, Japan.	Grain size is one of the most important agricultural traits in rice. To increase grain yield, we screened a large grain mutant from mutants with the 'Koshihikari' background. As a result, we obtained a mutant, KEMS39, that has a large grain size and increased yield. Cultivation tests revealed that this mutant had improved lodging resistance with thicker internodes. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed the presence of a 67 bp deletion in the GW2 mRNA, owing to a mutation in the 3' splice site of the sixth intron of the GW2 gene. To determine whether this mutation was responsible for the larger grain and thicker internodes, we performed gene editing and obtained a mutant with a 7 bp deletion, including this 3' splice site. As this gw2 mutant had large grains and thicker internodes, the causal gene of KEMS39 was determined as GW2. Thicker internodes are attributed to the pleiotropic effect of gw2 mutation. On the basis of these results, we conclude that gw2 mutation has the potential to be an important genetic resource with the ability to achieve a well-balanced and high-yielding effect that simultaneously improves grain productivity and lodging resistance.
NA	RING-Type E3 Ubiqitin Ligase Barley Genes ( HvYrg1-2) Control Characteristics of Both Vegetative Organs and Seeds as Yield Components	2020	Plants (Basel) .	Institute of Plant Biology, Biological Research Centre, Temesv¨¢ri krt. 62., H-6726 Szeged, Hungary.	Previously, studies on RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases in cereals were preferentially focused on GW2 genes primarily controlling seed parameters in rice and wheat. Here we report cloning two HvYrg genes from barley that share significant homology with rice GW2 gene. In antisense genotypes efficiency of gene silencing varied between genes and transgenic lines: ASHvYrg1: 30-50% and ASHvYrg2: 20-27%. Reduced activity of both genes altered shoot system with increasing number of side shoots. Changes in leaf width, weight, or plant weight and height reached significant levels in some transgenic lines. Lowering expression of the two barley HvYrg genes caused opposite responses in spike development. Plants with ASHvYrg1 gene construct showed earlier heading time and prolonged grain-filling period, while plants from ASHvYrg2 genotype flowered in delay. Digital imaging of root development revealed that down-regulation of HvYrg1 gene variant stimulated root growth, while ASHvYrg2 plants developed reduced root system. Comparison of seed parameters indicated an increase in thousand grain weight accompanied with longer and wider seed morphology. In summary we conclude that in contrast to inhibition of GW2 genes in rice and wheat plants, down-regulation of the barely HvYrg genes caused substantial changes in vegetative organs in addition to alteration of seed parameters.
NA	OrMKK3 Influences Morphology and Grain Size in Rice	2021	J Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute, Guangxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences/Guangxi Key Laboratory of Rice Genetics and Breeding, Nanning, 530007 China.	Although morphology and grain size are important to rice growth and yield, the identity of abundant natural allelic variations that determine agronomically important differences in crops is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3 from Oryza officinalis Wall. ex Watt encoded by OrMKK3. Different alternative splicing variants occurred in OrMKK3. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-OrMKK3 fusion proteins localized to the cell membrane and nuclei of rice protoplasts. Overexpression of OrMKK3 influenced the expression levels of the grain size-related genes SMG1, GW8, GL3, GW2, and DEP3. Phylogenetic analysis showed that OrMKK3 is well conserved in plants while showing large amounts of variation between indica, japonica, and wild rice. In addition, OrMKK3 slightly influenced brassinosteroid (BR) responses and the expression levels of BR-related genes. Our findings thus identify a new gene, OrMKK3, influencing morphology and grain size and that represents a possible link between mitogen-activated protein kinase and BR response pathways in grain growth.
