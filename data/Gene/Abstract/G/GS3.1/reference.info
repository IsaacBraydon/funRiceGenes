NA	A rice QTL GS3.1 regulates grain size through metabolic-flux distribution between flavonoid and lignin metabolons without affecting stress tolerance.	2021	Commun Biol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics &amp; Development, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Grain size is a key component trait of grain weight and yield. Numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in various bioprocesses, but there is still little known about how metabolism-related QTLs influence grain size and yield. The current study report GS3.1, a QTL that regulates rice grain size via metabolic flux allocation between two branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism. GS3.1 encodes a MATE (multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion) transporter that regulates grain size by directing the transport of p-coumaric acid from the p-coumaric acid biosynthetic metabolon to the flavonoid biosynthetic metabolon. A natural allele of GS3.1 was identified from an African rice with enlarged grains, reduced flavonoid content and increased lignin content in the panicles. Notably, the natural allele of GS3.1 caused no alterations in other tissues and did not affect stress tolerance, revealing an ideal candidate for breeding efforts. This study uncovers insights into the regulation of grain size though metabolic-flux distribution. In this way, it supports a strategy of enhancing crop yield without introducing deleterious side effects on stress tolerance mechanisms.
NA	Leaf-derived ABA regulates rice seed development via a transporter-mediated and temperature-sensitive mechanism.	2021	Sci Adv	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. lishigui@sicau.edu.cn xiangcb@ustc.edu.cn qinpeng@sicau.edu.cn.	Long-distance transport of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) has been studied for ~50 years, yet its mechanistic basis and biological significance remain very poorly understood. Here, we show that leaf-derived ABA controls rice seed development in a temperature-dependent manner and is regulated by defective grain-filling 1 (DG1), a multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporter that effluxes ABA at nodes and rachilla. Specifically, ABA is biosynthesized in both WT and dg1 leaves, but only WT caryopses accumulate leaf-derived ABA. Our demonstration that leaf-derived ABA activates starch synthesis genes explains the incompletely filled and floury seed phenotypes in dg1 Both the DG1-mediated long-distance ABA transport efficiency and grain-filling phenotypes are temperature sensitive. Moreover, we extended these mechanistic insights to other cereals by observing similar grain-filling defects in a maize DG1 ortholog mutant. Our study demonstrates that rice uses a leaf-to-caryopsis ABA transport-based mechanism to ensure normal seed development in response to variable temperatures.
NA	MATE transporter GFD1 cooperates with sugar transporters, mediates carbohydrate partitioning and controls grain-filling duration, grain size and number in rice.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	More than half of the world&#x27;s food is provided by cereals, as humans obtain &gt;60% of daily calories from grains. Producing more carbohydrates is always the final target of crop cultivation. The carbohydrate partitioning pathway directly affects grain yield, but the molecular mechanisms and biological functions are poorly understood, including rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important food sources. Here, we reported a prolonged grain filling duration mutant 1 (gfd1), exhibiting a long grain-filling duration, less grain number per panicle and bigger grain size without changing grain weight. Map-based cloning and molecular biological analyses revealed that GFD1 encoded a MATE transporter and expressed high in vascular tissues of the stem, spikelet hulls and rachilla, but low in the leaf, controlling carbohydrate partitioning in the stem and grain but not in the leaf. GFD1 protein was partially localized on the plasma membrane and in the Golgi apparatus, and was finally verified to interact with two sugar transporters, OsSWEET4 and OsSUT2. Genetic analyses showed that GFD1 might control grain-filling duration through OsSWEET4, adjust grain size with OsSUT2 and synergistically modulate grain number per panicle with both OsSUT2 and OsSWEET4. Together, our work proved that the three transporters, which are all initially classified in the major facilitator superfamily family, could control starch storage in both the primary sink (grain) and temporary sink (stem), and affect carbohydrate partitioning in the whole plant through physical interaction, giving a new vision of sugar transporter interactome and providing a tool for rice yield improvement.
