Grain size is a key component trait of grain weight and yield. Numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in various bioprocesses, but there is still little known about how metabolism-related QTLs influence grain size and yield. The current study report GS3.1, a QTL that regulates rice grain size via metabolic flux allocation between two branches of phenylpropanoid metabolism. GS3.1 encodes a MATE (multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion) transporter that regulates grain size by directing the transport of p-coumaric acid from the p-coumaric acid biosynthetic metabolon to the flavonoid biosynthetic metabolon. A natural allele of GS3.1 was identified from an African rice with enlarged grains, reduced flavonoid content and increased lignin content in the panicles. Notably, the natural allele of GS3.1 caused no alterations in other tissues and did not affect stress tolerance, revealing an ideal candidate for breeding efforts. This study uncovers insights into the regulation of grain size though metabolic-flux distribution. In this way, it supports a strategy of enhancing crop yield without introducing deleterious side effects on stress tolerance mechanisms.
