El-Kereamy-2012-The rice R2R3-MYB tr.pdf	The rice R2R3-MYB transcription factor OsMYB55 is involved in the tolerance to high temperature and modulates amino acid metabolism	2012	PLoS One	Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada.	Temperatures higher than the optimum negatively affects plant growth and development. Tolerance to high temperature is a complex process that involves several pathways. Understanding this process, especially in crops such as rice, is essential to prepare for predicted climate changes due to global warming. Here, we show that OsMYB55 is induced by high temperature and overexpression of OsMYB55 resulted in improved plant growth under high temperature and decreased the negative effect of high temperature on grain yield. Transcriptome analysis revealed an increase in expression of several genes involved in amino acids metabolism. We demonstrate that OsMYB55 binds to the promoter regions of target genes and directly activates expression of some of those genes including glutamine synthetase (OsGS1;2) glutamine amidotransferase (GAT1) and glutamate decarboxylase 3 (GAD3). OsMYB55 overexpression resulted in an increase in total amino acid content and of the individual amino acids produced by the activation of the above mentioned genes and known for their roles in stress tolerance, namely L-glutamic acid, GABA and arginine especially under high temperature condition. In conclusion, overexpression of OsMYB55 improves rice plant tolerance to high temperature, and this high tolerance is associated with enhanced amino acid metabolism through transcription activation.
NA	An In Vivo Targeted Deletion of the Calmodulin-Binding Domain from Rice Glutamate Decarboxylase 3 (OsGAD3) Increases ¦Ã-Aminobutyric Acid Content in Grains.	2020	Rice (N Y)	Department of Life Science, Shimane University, 1060 Nishikawatsu, Matsue, Shimane, 690-8504, Japan. akama@life.shimane-u.ac.jp.	Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid present in all living things. GABA is mainly synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). In plants the enzymatic activity of GAD is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin binding (CaMBD) at the C-terminus in response to various stresses, allowing rapid GABA accumulation in cells. GABA plays a central role in not only stress responses but also many aspects of plant growth and development as a signaling molecules. Furthermore, it is known to be a health-promoting functional substance that exerts improvements in life-style related diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and so on. Previous reports indicated that CaMBD found plant GADs possess an autoinhibitory function because truncation of GAD resulted in extreme GABA accumulation in plant cells. Therefore, we attempted a genetic modification of rice GAD via genome editing technology to increase GABA levels in the edible part of rice.In this study, we focused on GAD3, one of five GAD genes present in the rice genome, because GAD3 is the predominantly expressed in seeds, as reported previously. We confirmed that GAD3 has an authentic Ca2+/CaMBD that functions as an autoinhibitory domain. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was performed to trim the coding region of CaMBD off from the OsGAD3 gene, then introducing this transgene into rice scutellum-derived calli using an all-in-one vector harboring guide RNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 via Agrobacterium to regenerate rice plants. Out of 24 transformed rice (T1), a genome-edited rice line (#8_8) derived from two independent cleavages and ligations in the N-terminal position encoding OsGAD3-CaMBD and 40<U+2009>bp downstream of the termination codon, respectively, displayed a AKNQDAAD peptide in the C-terminal region of the putative OsGAD3 in place of its intact CaMBD (bold indicates the trace of the N-terminal dipeptides of the authentic CaMBD). A very similar rice line (#8_1) carrying AKNRSSRRSGR in OsGAD3 was obtained from one base pair deletion in the N-terminal coding region of the CaMBD. Free amino acid analysis of the seeds (T2) indicated that the former line contained seven-fold higher levels of GABA than wild-type, whereas the latter line had similar levels to the wild-type, although in vitro enzyme activities of recombinant GAD proteins based on the GAD3 amino acid sequence elucidated from these two lines in the absence of Ca2+/bovine CaM were both higher than wild-type counterpart. In addition to high level of GABA in #8_8, the average seed weight per grain and protein content were superior to wild-type and #8_1.We have successfully established GABA-fortified rice by using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology. Modified rice contained seven-fold higher GABA content and furthermore displayed significantly higher grain weight and protein content than wild-type brown rice. This is the first report of the production of GABA-enriched rice via a genome editing.
