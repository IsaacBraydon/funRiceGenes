Low glutelin-content gene Lgc1 in rice has a 3.5-kb deletion between two highly similar glutelin genes GluB4 and GluB5, which locates on the short arm of chromosome 2. To improve the selection efficiency in low glutelin-content rice breeding, two molecular markers designated as InDel-Lgc1-1 and InDel-Lgc1-2 were developed to detect the low glutelin-content gene Lgc1. A double PCR detection indicated that combined use of the two markers could easily distinguish the genotypes of Lgc1 from different rice varieties. Therefore, as a simple and low-cost technique, the molecular marker could be widely used to identify different varieties with Lgc1 gene and applied in marker-assisted selection of low glutelin-content rice.

Low glutelin content1 (Lgc1) is a dominant mutation that reduces glutelin content in rice grains. Glutelin is a major seed storage protein encoded by a multigene family. RNA gel blot and reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR analyses revealed that Lgc1 acts at the mRNA level in a similarity-dependent manner. In Lgc1 homozygotes, there is a 3.5-kb deletion between two highly similar glutelin genes that forms a tail-to-tail inverted repeat, which might produce a double-stranded RNA molecule, a potent inducer of RNA silencing. The hypothesis that Lgc1 suppresses glutelin expression via RNA silencing is supported by transgenic analysis using this Lgc1 candidate region, by reporter gene analysis, and by the detection of small interfering RNAs. In this context, Lgc1 provides an interesting example of RNA silencing occurring among genes that exhibit various levels of similarity to an RNA-silencing-inducing gene. Possible mechanisms for gene silencing of the glutelin multigene family by Lgc1 are discussed.
