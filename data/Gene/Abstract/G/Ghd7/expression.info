Ghd7	We carried out RNA in situ hybridization and Ghd7 promoter¨Cdriven GFP transformation to examine sites of Ghd7 expression. The RNA in situ hybridization signals indicated that the gene is expressed in young tissues, such as the apical meristem, developing leaves and the leaf sheaths of the young seedling, the meristem of the root, the epidermal layer of developing stems and the branch-primordia of developing panicles	Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size. 	Natural mutants with reduced function enable rice to be cultivated in temperate and cooler regions.
