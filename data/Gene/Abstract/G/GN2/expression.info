GN2	 Interestingly, GN2 arose through the insertion of a 1,094-bp sequence from LOC_Os02g45150 into the third exon of LOC_Os02g56630, and the inserted sequence recruited its nearby sequence to generate the chimeric GN2 The gene structure and expression pattern of GN2 were distinct from those of LOC_Os02g45150 and LOC_Os02g56630 A sequence analysis showed that GN2 may be generated in the natural population of 'Yuanjiang' common wild rice
