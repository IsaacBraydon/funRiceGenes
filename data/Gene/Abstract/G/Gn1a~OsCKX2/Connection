DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	Gn1a|OsCKX2	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets
EP3|LP	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression
Gn1a|OsCKX2	GS3	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.
Gn1a|OsCKX2	GS3	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.	Shuhui498 (R498) is an elite parent of heavy panicle hybrid rice by pyramiding the rare gn1a and null gs3 alleles
Gn1a|OsCKX2	GS3	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.	 Here, we report that the combination of loss-of-function mutations in Grain number 1a (Gn1a) and Grain Size 3 (GS3) is responsible for the heavy panicle phenotype of the elite hybrid rice restorer line Shuhui498 (R498)
Gn1a|OsCKX2	GS3	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.	 The null gn1a allele is the determinant factor for heavy panicles through increased grain number, while gs3 is associated with grain size and weight
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that, among the downregulated genes, OsVIL2 was directly associated with chromatins in the promoter region of CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE2 (OsCKX2), a gene responsible for cytokinin degradation
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsVIL2	Chromatin interacting factor OsVIL2 increases biomass and rice grain yield.	 We conclude that OsVIL2 improves the production of biomass and grain by suppressing OsCKX2 chromatin
Gn1a|OsCKX2	OsAFB6	Overexpression of an auxin receptor OsAFB6 significantly enhanced grain yield by increasing cytokinin and decreasing auxin concentrations in rice panicle.	 Overexpression of OsAFB6 delayed heading, increased cytokinin (CK) by suppressing the expression level of Gn1a and simultaneously decreased the IAA concentration in the young panicle, which promoted inflorescence meristem development and resulted in large panicles with more spikelets per panicle, primary branches and increased grain yield
Gn1a|OsCKX2	ONAC096	Mutation of ONAC096 Enhances Grain Yield by Increasing Panicle Number and Delaying Leaf Senescence during Grain Filling in Rice.	 Repressed OsCKX2 (encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) expression in the onac096 mutants led to a 15% increase in panicle number without affecting grain weight or fertility
