DEP1|DN1|qPE9-1|OsDEP1	Gn1a|OsCKX2	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	 The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets
EP3|LP	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	 Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	 Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	 DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	 We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	 Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production
DST	Gn1a|OsCKX2	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression
