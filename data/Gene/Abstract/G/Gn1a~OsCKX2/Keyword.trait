Gn1a|OsCKX2	 pi 	OsCKX2 regulates phosphate deficiency tolerance by modulating cytokinin in rice.	 The present study analyzed the phenotypic and physiological characteristics of OsCKX2 overexpressing (OE) and knockout (KO) rice plants after exposure to phosphate (Pi) deficiency and the transcriptome and metabolome to investigate the function of OsCKX2 in response to Pi deficiency
Gn1a|OsCKX2	 pi 	OsCKX2 regulates phosphate deficiency tolerance by modulating cytokinin in rice.	 OsCKX2 KO plants demonstrated higher endogenous CTK levels than wild-type (WT) under Pi deficiency
Gn1a|OsCKX2	 pi 	OsCKX2 regulates phosphate deficiency tolerance by modulating cytokinin in rice.	 Further analysis indicated more robust tolerance of OsCKX2 KO plants to Pi deficiency, which exhibited higher phosphorus concentration, larger shoot biomass, and lesser leaf yellowing under Pi deficiency; whereas the opposite was observed for OsCKX2 OE plants
