60862708.pdf	A loss-of-function mutation of rice DENSE PANICLE 1 causes semi-dwarfness and slightly increased number of spikelets	2011	Breeding Science	QTL Genomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences	In cereal breeding, semi-dwarfness and an increased spikelet number are favorable characteristics. We show that the rice DENSE PANICLE 1 (DN1) mutant allele Dn1-1 causes both of these characteristics and that Dn1-1 is a loss-of-function mutation. DN1 is allelic to DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 1 (DEP1) (=qPE(9-1)). The expression level of OsCKX2 in the shoot apex of Dn1-1 plants is similar to that in the wild type, indicating that OsCKX2 does not contribute to an increased number of spikelets. A comparison of the Dn1-1 and Dn1-3 alleles suggests that the N-terminal region of DN1 contains a coiled-coil domain and a nuclear localization signal that might be responsible for semi-dwarfness. This comparison also revealed that a single transmembrane alpha-helix, a VWFC module, and a four-disulfide core domain can further increase spikelet number. Subcellular localization analysis of the DN1 protein fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) implies that DN1 is located in the nucleus and cell membrane and that its N-terminal fragment is cleaved. Dn1-1 plants have normal sensitivity to gibberellin, brassinolide, and kinetin, and we observed no genetic epistasis with brassinolide-related mutants, suggesting that DN1 does not function in the signaling pathways of these phytohormones.
j.1467-7652.2011.00610.x.pdf	Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice	2011	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Panicle architecture is one of the most important agronomical traits that directly contribute to grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture. Morphological analyses reveal that panicles of two mutants produced more inflorescence branches, especially the primary branches, and contained more grains. Moreover, mutant plants also display more lodging resistance than the wild type. The grain yield per plant in mutants is also increased, suggesting that mutant plants have useful potential for high grain yield in rice breeding. Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein. RNA in situ hybridization studies display that LP expression was enriched in the branch primordial region. Subcellular localization analyses demonstrate that LP is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, suggesting that LP might be involved in ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Using yeast two-hybrid assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we confirm that LP is an F-box protein and could interact with rice SKP1-like protein in an F-box domain-dependent manner. Quantitative real-time PCR results show that OsCKX2, which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, is down-regulated evidently in mutants, implying that LP might be involved in modulating cytokinin level in plant tissues. These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants.
PNAS-2013-Li-3167-72.pdf	Rice zinc finger protein DST enhances grain production through controlling Gn1a/OsCKX2 expression	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	The phytohormone cytokinin (CK) positively regulates the activity and function of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which is a major parameter determining seed production. The rice (Oryza sativa L.) Gn1a/OsCKX2 (Grain number 1a/Cytokinin oxidase 2) gene, which encodes a cytokinin oxidase, has been identified as a major quantitative trait locus contributing to grain number improvement in rice breeding practice. However, the molecular mechanism of how the expression of OsCKX2 is regulated in planta remains elusive. Here, we report that the zinc finger transcription factor DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE (DST) directly regulates OsCKX2 expression in the reproductive meristem. DST-directed expression of OsCKX2 regulates CK accumulation in the SAM and, therefore, controls the number of the reproductive organs. We identify that DST(reg1), a semidominant allele of the DST gene, perturbs DST-directed regulation of OsCKX2 expression and elevates CK levels in the reproductive SAM, leading to increased meristem activity, enhanced panicle branching, and a consequent increase of grain number. Importantly, the DST(reg1) allele provides an approach to pyramid the Gn1a-dependent and Gn1a-independent effects on grain production. Our study reveals that, as a unique regulator of reproductive meristem activity, DST may be explored to facilitate the genetic enhancement of grain production in rice and other small grain cereals.
Science-2005-Ashikari-741-5.pdf	Cytokinin oxidase regulates rice grain production	2005	Science	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	Most agriculturally important traits are regulated by genes known as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural allelic variations. We here show that a QTL that increases grain productivity in rice, Gn1a, is a gene for cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (OsCKX2), an enzyme that degrades the phytohormone cytokinin. Reduced expression of OsCKX2 causes cytokinin accumulation in inflorescence meristems and increases the number of reproductive organs, resulting in enhanced grain yield. QTL pyramiding to combine loci for grain number and plant height in the same genetic background generated lines exhibiting both beneficial traits. These results provide a strategy for tailormade crop improvement.
NA	Down-Regulation of Cytokinin Oxidase 2 Expression Increases Tiller Number and Improves Rice Yield.	2015	Rice (N Y)	Biodiversity Research Center and Genome Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, 115, Taiwan.	Cytokinins are plant-specific hormones that affect plant growth and development. The endogenous level of cytokinins in plant cells is regulated in part by irreversible degradation via cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX). Among the 11 rice CKXs, CKX2 has been implicated in regulation of rice grain yield.To specifically down-regulate OsCKX2 expression, we have chosen two conserved glycosylation regions of OsCKX2 for designing artificial short hairpin RNA interference genes (shRNA-CX3 and -CX5, representing the 5' and 3' glycosylation region sequences, respectively) for transformation by the Agrobacterium-mediated method. For each construct, 5 independent transgenic lines were obtained for detailed analysis. Southern blot analysis confirmed the integration of the shRNA genes into the rice genome, and quantitative real time RT-PCR and northern blot analyses showed reduced OsCKX2 expression in the young stem of transgenic rice at varying degrees. However, the expression of other rice CKX genes, such as CKX1 and CKX3, in these transgenic lines was not altered. Transgenic rice plants grown in the greenhouse were greener and more vigorous with delayed senescence, compared to the wild type. In field experiments, both CX3 and CX5 transgenic rice plants produced more tillers (27-81 %) and grains (24-67 %) per plant and had a heavier 1000 grain weight (5-15 %) than the wild type. The increases in grain yield were highly correlated with increased tiller numbers. Consistently, insertional activation of OsCKX2 led to increased expression of CKX2 and reduced tiller number and growth in a gene-dosage dependant manner.Taken together, these results demonstrate that specific suppression of OsCKX2 expression through shRNA-mediated gene silencing leads to enhanced growth and productivity in rice by increasing tiller number and grain weight.
NA	Artificial Selection of Gn1a Plays an Important role in Improving Rice Yields Across Different Ecological Regions.	2015	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice; Key Laboratory for Research and Utilization of Heterosis in Indica Rice of Ministry of Agriculture; Engineering Research Center for Plant Biotechnology and Germplasm Utilization of Ministry of Education; College of Life Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	Rice is one of the most important crops, and it is essential to improve rice productivity to satisfy the future global food supply demands. Gn1a (OsCKX2), which encodes cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, plays an important role in regulating rice grain yield.In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation of Gn1a, which influences grain yield through controlling the number of spikelets in rice. The allelic variations in the promoter, 5' untranslated region (UTR) and coding sequence (CDS) of Gn1a were investigated in 175 cultivars and 21 wild rice accessions. We found that Gn1a showed less sequence variation in the cultivars, but exhibited significant nucleotide diversity in wild rice. A total of 14 alleles, named AP1 to AP14, were identified in the cultivars based on the amino acid divergence of GN1A. Association analysis revealed that the number of spikelets and grain yield were significantly different between the different alleles. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three main alleles, AP3, AP8 and AP9, in the cultivars might originate from a common ancestor allele, AP1, in wild rice.Of these alleles in the cultivars, AP9 was suggested as the best allele in indica, as it has shown strong artificial selection in breeding high-yield rice in the past. It might be valuable to explore the high-yield-related alleles of Gn1a to develop high-yield rice cultivars in future breeding programs.
NA	TKnockdown of an inflorescence meristem-specific cytokinin oxidase - OsCKX2 in rice reduces yield penalty under salinity stress condition.	2017	Plant Cell Environ	Plant Stress Biology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, 110 067, India.	Cytokinins play a significant role in determining grain yield in plants. Cytokinin oxidases catalyze irreversible degradation of cytokinins and hence modulate cellular cytokinin levels. Here, we studied the role of an inflorescence meristem-specific rice cytokinin oxidase - OsCKX2, in reducing yield penalty under salinity stress conditions. We utilized an RNAi-based approach to study the function of OsCKX2 in maintaining grain yield under salinity stress condition. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-based estimation revealed a significant increase in cytokinins in the inflorescence meristem of OsCKX2-knockdown plants. To determine if there exists, a correlation between OsCKX2 levels and yield under salinity stress condition, we assessed the growth, physiology and grain yield of OsCKX2-knockdown plants vis-à-vis the wild-type. OsCKX2-knockdown plants showed better vegetative growth, higher relative water content as well as photosynthetic efficiency, and reduced electrolyte leakage as compared to the wild-type under salinity stress. Importantly, we found a negative-correlation between OsCKX2 expression and plant productivity as evident by assessment of agronomical parameters such as panicle branching, filled grains per plant, and harvest index both under control and salinity stress conditions. These results suggest that OsCKX2, via controlling cytokinin levels, regulates floral primordial activity modulating rice grain yield under normal as well as abiotic stress conditions.
NA	Updating the elite rice variety Kongyu 131 by improving the Gn1a locus.	2017	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No.3 South Zhongguancun Road, Haidian District, Beijing, 100190, People's Republic of China.	Kongyu 131 is an elite japonica rice variety of Heilongjiang Province, China. It has the characteristics of early maturity, superior quality, high yield, cold tolerance and wide adaptability. However, there is potential to improve the yield of Kongyu 131 because of the relatively few grains per panicle compared with other varieties. Hence, we rebuilt the genome of Kongyu 131 by replacing the GRAIN NUMBER1a (Gn1a) locus with a high-yielding allele from a big panicle indica rice variety, GKBR. High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis was used for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping.Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of the BC3F2 population showed that the introgressed segment carrying the Gn1a allele of GKBR significantly increased the branch number and grain number per panicle. Using 5 SNP markers designed against the sequence within and around Gn1a, the introgressed chromosome segment was shortened to approximately 430 Kb to minimize the linkage drag by screening recombinants in the target region. Genomic components of the new Kongyu 131 were detected using 220 SNP markers evenly distributed across 12 chromosomes, suggesting that the recovery ratio of the recurrent parent genome (RRPG) was 99.89%. Compared with Kongyu 131, the yield per plant of the new Kongyu 131 increased by 8.3% and 11.9% at Changchun and Jiamusi, respectively.To achieve the high yield potential of Kongyu 131, a minute chromosome fragment carrying the favorable Gn1a allele from the donor parent was introgressed into the genome of Kongyu 131, which resulted in a larger panicle and subsequent yield increase in the new Kongyu 131. These results indicate the feasibility of improving an undesirable trait of an elite variety by replacing only a small chromosome segment carrying a favorable allele.
NA	Dissecting the genetic basis of heavy panicle hybrid rice uncovered Gn1a and GS3 as key genes.	2018	Theor Appl Genet	Rice Research Institute, Sichuan Agricultural University, 211 Huimin Road, Wenjiang, 611130, Sichuan, People's Republic of China.	Shuhui498 (R498) is an elite parent of heavy panicle hybrid rice by pyramiding the rare gn1a and null gs3 alleles. This finding reveals the genetic basis and great potential application in future breeding of R498. The heavy panicle trait, defined as 5<U+00A0>g or more of grain weight per panicle, is one of the target traits in super-high-yield rice breeding programs. The use of heavy panicle-type hybrid rice has been shown to be a successful strategy for super-high-yield breeding programs, particularly under the environmental conditions of high humidity and deficient solar radiation in southwestern China. However, the genetic components of the heavy panicle trait in hybrid rice remain elusive. Here, we report that the combination of loss-of-function mutations in Grain number 1a (Gn1a) and Grain Size 3 (GS3) is responsible for the heavy panicle phenotype of the elite hybrid rice restorer line Shuhui498 (R498). The null gn1a allele is the determinant factor for heavy panicles through increased grain number, while gs3 is associated with grain size and weight. R498 pyramided the two major null alleles, resulting in heavy panicles with a high grain number and large grains. Clustering analysis revealed that the null gn1aR498allele is a rare haplotype which has been innovatively utilized in R498, underscoring the great potential of R498 for breeding purposes. Our research thus sheds light on the distinct genetic compositions of heavy panicle-type rice and may potentially facilitate super-high-yield rice breeding.
NA	Phenotypic, Transcriptomic, and Metabolomic Signatures of Root-Specifically Overexpressed OsCKX2 in Rice	2020	Front Plant Sci	Henan Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Grain Crops, Henan Agricultural University, Zhengzhou, China.	Cytokinins are crucial signaling molecules that regulate plant growth and development. OsCKX2 irreversibly degrades nucleobase cytokinins by encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase to control grain production in rice. In this study, OsCKX2 was specifically overexpressed in roots using RCc3 promoter to investigate the effects of root-source cytokinins on the growth of rice. OsCKX2 overexpressed (OE) rice showed retarded growth with lower cytokinin levels and biomass production. Shoot-specific transcriptome analysis between OsCKX2 OE rice and wild type (WT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell division, cell wall structure, phytohormone signaling, and assimilation and catabolism. Metabolome analysis indicated that a majority of differential primary metabolites, such as amino acids and organic acids, increased, while lipids decreased in OsCKX2 OE rice. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data showed that several DEGs and differential metabolites were related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). To conclude, reduced cytokinin levels via root-specific overexpression of OsCKX2 resulted in developmental defects, which confirmed the importance of root-source cytokinins in plant growth and morphogenesis.
