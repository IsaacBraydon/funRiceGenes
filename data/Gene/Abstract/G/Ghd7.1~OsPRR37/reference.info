jipb12070.pdf	Validation and characterization of Ghd7.1, a major quantitative trait locus with pleiotropic effects on spikelets per panicle, plant height, and heading date in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2013	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	A quantitative trait locus (QTL) that affects heading date (HD) and the number of spikelets per panicle (SPP) was previously identified in a small region on chromosome 7 in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In order to further characterize the QTL region, near isogenic lines (NILs) were quickly obtained by self-crossing recombinant inbred line 189, which is heterozygous in the vicinity of the target region. The pleiotropic effects of QTL Ghd7.1 on plant height (PH), SPP, and HD, were validated using an NIL-F2 population. Ghd7.1 explained 50.2%, 45.3%, and 76.9% of phenotypic variation in PH, SPP, and HD, respectively. Ghd7.1 was precisely mapped to a 357-kb region on the basis of analysis of the progeny of the NIL-F2 population. Day-length treatment confirmed that Ghd7.1 is sensitive to photoperiod, with long days delaying heading up to 12.5 d. Identification of panicle initiation and development for the pair of NILs showed that Ghd7.1 elongated the photoperiod-sensitive phase more than 10 d, but did not change the basic vegetative phase and the reproductive growth phase. These findings indicated that Ghd7.1 regulates SPP by controlling the rate of panicle differentiation rather than the duration of panicle development.
Mol. Plant-2013-Koo-mp-sst088.pdf	Natural variation in OsPRR37 regulates heading date and contributes to rice cultivation at a wide range of latitudes	2013	Mol Plant	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.	Heading date and photoperiod sensitivity are fundamental traits that determine rice adaptation to a wide range of geographic environments. By quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and candidate gene analysis using whole-genome re-sequencing, we found that Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) is responsible for the Early heading7-2 (EH7-2)/Heading date2 (Hd2) QTL which was identified from a cross of late-heading rice 'Milyang23 (M23)' and early-heading rice 'H143'. H143 contains a missense mutation of an invariantly conserved amino acid in the CCT (CONSTANS, CO-like, and TOC1) domain of PRR37 protein. In the world rice collection, different types of nonfunctional PRR37 alleles were found in many European and Asian rice cultivars. Notably, the japonica varieties harboring nonfunctional alleles of both Ghd7/Hd4 and PRR37/Hd2 flower extremely early under natural long-day conditions, and are adapted to the northernmost regions of rice cultivation, up to 53 degrees N latitude. Genetic analysis revealed that the effects of PRR37 and Ghd7 alleles on heading date are additive, and PRR37 down-regulates Hd3a expression to suppress flowering under long-day conditions. Our results demonstrate that natural variations in PRR37/Hd2 and Ghd7/Hd4 have contributed to the expansion of rice cultivation to temperate and cooler regions.
NA	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	2014	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 100081 Beijing, China; National Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095 Nanjing, China;	Success of modern agriculture relies heavily on breeding of crops with maximal regional adaptability and yield potentials. A major limiting factor for crop cultivation is their flowering time, which is strongly regulated by day length (photoperiod) and temperature. Here we report identification and characterization of Days to heading 7 (DTH7), a major genetic locus underlying photoperiod sensitivity and grain yield in rice. Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod. We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering. Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions. Our data provide not only a macroscopic view of the genetic control of photoperiod sensitivity in rice but also a foundation for breeding of rice cultivars better adapted to the target environments using rational design.
NA	Casein Kinases I and 2α Phosphorylate Oryza Sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37) in Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	2014	Mol Cells	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.	Flowering time (or heading date) is controlled by intrinsic genetic programs in response to environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature. Rice, a facultative shortday (SD) plant, flowers early in SD and late in long-day (LD) conditions. Casein kinases (CKs) generally act as positive regulators in many signaling pathways in plants. In rice, Heading date 6 (Hd6) and Hd16 encode CK2α and CKI, respectively, and mainly function to delay flowering time. Additionally, the major LD-dependent floral repressors Hd2/Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator 37 (OsPRR37; hereafter PRR37) andGhd7 also confer strong photoperiod sensitivity. In floral induction, Hd16 acts upstream of Ghd7 and CKI interacts with and phosphorylates Ghd7. In addition, Hd6 and Hd16 also act upstream of Hd2. However, whether CKI and CK2α directly regulate the function of PRR37 remains unclear. Here, we use in vitro pull-down and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays to show that CKI and CK2α interact with PRR37. We further use in vitro kinase assays to show that CKI and CK2α phosphorylate different regions of PRR37. Our results indicate that direct posttranslational modification of PRR37 mediates the genetic interactions between these two protein kinases and PRR37. The significance of CK-mediated phosphorylation for PRR37 and Ghd7 function is discussed.
NA	OsPRR37 and Ghd7 are the major genes for general combining ability of DTH, PH and SPP in rice.	2015	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice and College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, 430072, China.	Artificial selection of high yield crops and better livestock is paramount importance in breeding programs. Selection of elite parents with preferred traits from a phalanx of inbred lines is extremely laborious, time-consuming and highly random. General combining ability (GCA) was proposed and has been widely used for the evaluation of parents in hybrid breeding for more than half a century. However, the genetic and molecular basis of GCA has been largely overlooked. Here, we present two pleotropic QTLs are accounting for GCA of days to heading (DTH), plant height (PH) and spikelet per panicle (SPP) using an F2-based NCII design, the BC3F2 population as well as a set of nearly isogenic lines (NILs) with five testers. Both GCA1 and GCA2 were loss-of-function gene in low-GCA parent and gain-of-function gene in high-GCA parent, encoding the putative Pseudo-Response Regulators, OsPRR37 and Ghd7, respectively. Overexpression of GCA1 in low-GCA parent significantly increases GCA effects in three traits. Our results demonstrate that two GCA loci associate with OsPRR37 and Ghd7 and reveal that the genes responsible for important agronomic traits could simultaneously account for GCA effects.
NA	OsPRR37 confers an expanded regulation of the diurnal rhythms of the transcriptome and photoperiodic flowering pathways in rice.	2018	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.	The circadian clock enables organisms to rapidly adapt to the ever-changing environmental conditions that are caused by daily light/dark cycles. Circadian clock genes universally affect key agricultural traits, particularly flowering time. Here, we show that OsPRR37, a circadian clock gene, delays rice flowering time in an expression level-dependent manner. Using high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on an OsPRR37 overexpressing transgenic line (OsPRR37-OE5) and the recipient parent Guangluai4 (GL) that contains the loss-of-function Osprr37, we identify 14,992 genes that display diurnal rhythms, which account for 52.9% of the transcriptome. Overexpressing OsPRR37 weakens the transcriptomic rhythms and alters the phases of rhythmic genes. In total, 3,210 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified, among which 1,863 rhythmic DEGs show a correlation between the change of absolute amplitudes and the mean expression levels. We further reveal that OsPRR37 functions as a transcriptional repressor to repress the expression levels and amplitudes of day-phased clock genes. More importantly, OsPRR37 confers expanded regulation on the evening-phased rhythmic DEGs by repressing the morning-phased rhythmic DEGs. Further study shows that OsPRR37 expands its regulation on flowering pathways by repressing Ehd1. Thus, our results demonstrate an expanded regulation mechanism of the circadian clock on the diurnal rhythms of the transcriptome.
NA	DivergentHd1,Ghd7, andDTH7Alleles Control Heading Date and Yield Potential ofJaponicaRice in Northeast China.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	The heading date is a vital factor in achieving a full rice yield. Cultivars with particular flowering behaviors have been artificially selected to survive in the long-day and low-temperature conditions of Northeast China. To dissect the genetic mechanism responsible for heading date in rice populations from Northeast China, association mapping was performed to identify major controlling loci. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified three genetic loci,Hd1,Ghd7, andDTH7, using general and mixed linear models. The three genes were sequenced to analyze natural variations and identify their functions. Loss-of-function alleles of these genes contributed to early rice heading dates in the northern regions of Northeast China, while functional alleles promoted late rice heading dates in the southern regions of Northeast China. Selecting environmentally appropriate allele combinations in new varieties is recommended during breeding. Introducing the earlyindicarice's genetic background into Northeastjaponicarice is a reasonable strategy for improving genetic diversity.
NA	Switching genetic effects of the flowering time gene Hd1 in LD conditions by Ghd7 and OsPRR37 in rice.	2019	Breed Sci	Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, National Agricultural Research Organization, Sapporo, Hokkaido 062-8555, Japan.	Flowering time control in plants is a major limiting factor on the range of species. Day length, perceived via the photoperiodic pathway, is a critical factor for the induction of flowering. The module of GIGANTEA (GI)-CONSTANS (CO)-FLOWERING LOCUS T in the long day (LD) plant Arabidopsis is conserved in diverse plant species including the short day (SD) plant rice, where this module comprises OsGI-Heading date 1 (Hd1)-Heading date 3a. Hd1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis CO, has dual functions in the regulation of flowering time, promoting flowering in SD conditions and delaying it in LD conditions. We herein show genetic interactions among three LD repressor genes: Hd1, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), and Oryza sativa Pseudo-Response Regulator37 (OsPRR37). Genetic analyses, including segregation analyses, evaluations of near isogenic lines, and transformation for flowering time demonstrated that Hd1 promoted flowering time in inductive SD and non-inductive LD conditions in genetic condition of loss-of-function Ghd7 and OsPRR37 (ghd7osprr37) in rice. Functional Ghd7 or OsPRR37 may switch the genetic effects of Hd1 from the promotion to the delay of flowering times in LD conditions.
