Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions
Ehd1	Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	 We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
