Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	 Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod |  We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	 Here, we show that OsPRR37, a circadian clock gene, delays rice flowering time in an expression level-dependent manner |  We further reveal that OsPRR37 functions as a transcriptional repressor to repress the expression levels and amplitudes of day-phased clock genes
