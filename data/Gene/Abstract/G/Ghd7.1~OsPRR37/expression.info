Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	 Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod |  We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	 Here, we show that OsPRR37, a circadian clock gene, delays rice flowering time in an expression level-dependent manner |  We further reveal that OsPRR37 functions as a transcriptional repressor to repress the expression levels and amplitudes of day-phased clock genes
Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	OsPRR37 Alternatively Promotes Heading Date Through Suppressing the Expression of Ghd7 in the Japonica Variety Zhonghua 11 under Natural Long-Day Conditions |  Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsPRR37 suppressed Ghd7 expression in both ZH11 background under NLD conditions and the Zhenshan 97 background under natural short-day conditions |  Consistently, the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 was enhanced by OsPRR37 in the ZH11 background
