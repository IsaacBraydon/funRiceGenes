Ghd7.1|Hd2|OsPRR37|DTH7	grain	Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.	Further, we find that haplotype combinations of DTH7 with Grain number, plant height, and heading date 7 (Ghd7) and DTH8 correlate well with the heading date and grain yield of rice under different photoperiod conditions
