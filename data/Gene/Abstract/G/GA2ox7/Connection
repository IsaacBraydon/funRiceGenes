GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	GA2ox7	Jasmonate-mediated gibberellin catabolism constrains growth during herbivore attack in rice.	 BPH infestation also increases inactive gibberellin (GA) levels and transcripts of GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox) genes, two (GA2ox3 and GA2ox7) of which encode enzymes that catalyze the conversion of bioactive GAs to inactive GAs in vitro and in vivo
GA2OX3|OsGA2OX3	GA2ox7	Jasmonate-mediated gibberellin catabolism constrains growth during herbivore attack in rice.	 The transcript levels of GA2ox3 and GA2ox7 were significantly attenuated under BPH attack in JA biosynthesis (allene oxide cyclase, aoc) or signaling-deficient (myc2) mutants
