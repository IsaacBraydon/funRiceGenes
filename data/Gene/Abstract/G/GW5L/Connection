GW5|qSW5	GW5L	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 However, the biological function of a GW5 homolog, named GW5-Like (GW5L), remains unknown
GW5|qSW5	GW5L	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 Biochemical assays verified that GW5L functions in a similar fashion to GW5
GW5|qSW5	GW5L	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 Genetic data show that GW5L overexpression in either Kitaake or a GW5 knockout line, Kasaorf3 (indica cv
GW5L	OsCam1-1	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
