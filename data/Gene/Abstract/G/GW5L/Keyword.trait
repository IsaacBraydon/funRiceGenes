GW5L	resistance	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 We also show that GW5L could confer salt stress resistance through an association with calmodulin protein OsCaM1-1
GW5L	resistance	GW5-Like, a homolog of GW5, negatively regulates grain width, weight and salt resistance in rice.	 These findings identify GW5L as a negative regulator of both grain size and salt stress tolerance, and provide a potential target for breeders to improve grain yield and salt stress resistance in rice
