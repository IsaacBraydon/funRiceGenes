Gns1	disease resistance	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	To assess the function of the Gns1 gene in disease resistance, we characterized transgenic rice plants constitutively expressing the Gns1 gene
Gns1	fertility	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
Gns1	disease	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene

Gns1	blast disease	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	RNA and protein gel blot analyses demonstrated that blast disease or dark treatment induced the expression of the Gns1 gene
Gns1	growth	Characterization of transgenic rice plants over-expressing the stress-inducible beta-glucanase gene Gns1	Although transgenic plants showed stunted growth and impaired root formation, fertility, germination, and coleoptile elongation appeared unaffected compared to non-transgenic control plants, indicating that Gns1 does not play a crucial role in rice germination and coleoptile elongation
