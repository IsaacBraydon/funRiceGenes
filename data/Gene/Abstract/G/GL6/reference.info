NA	The PLATZ transcription factor GL6 affects grain length and number in rice.	2019	Plant Physiol	National Center for Gene Research,CAS CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Grain size is one of the key determinants of grain yield. Although a number of genes that control grain size in rice (Oryza sativa) have been identified, the overall regulatory networks behind this process remain poorly understood. Here, we report the map-based cloning and functional characterization of the QTL GL6, which encodes a plant-specific PLATZ (plant AT-rich sequence- and zinc-binding) transcription factor that regulates rice grain length and spikelet number. GL6 positively controls grain length by promoting cell proliferation in young panicles and grains. The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle. We demonstrate that GL6 participates in RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcription machinery by interacting with RPC53 and TFC1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development. Our findings reveal a further player involved in the regulation of rice grain size that may be exploited in future rice breeding.
