NA	The PLATZ transcription factor GL6 affects grain length and number in rice.	2019	Plant Physiol	National Center for Gene Research,CAS CITY: Shanghai China [CN].	Grain size is one of the key determinants of grain yield. Although a number of genes that control grain size in rice (Oryza sativa) have been identified, the overall regulatory networks behind this process remain poorly understood. Here, we report the map-based cloning and functional characterization of the QTL GL6, which encodes a plant-specific PLATZ (plant AT-rich sequence- and zinc-binding) transcription factor that regulates rice grain length and spikelet number. GL6 positively controls grain length by promoting cell proliferation in young panicles and grains. The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle. We demonstrate that GL6 participates in RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcription machinery by interacting with RPC53 and TFC1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development. Our findings reveal a further player involved in the regulation of rice grain size that may be exploited in future rice breeding.
NA	The rice PLATZ protein SHORT GRAIN6 determines grain size by regulating spikelet hull cell division.	2019	J Integr Plant Biol	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 200032, Shanghai, China.	Grain size is a major determinant of cereal grain yields; however, the relevant regulatory mechanisms controlling this trait have not been fully elucidated. The rice (Oryza sativa) mutant short grain6 (sg6) was identified based on its reduced grain length and weight. Here, we functionally characterized the role of SG6 in determining grain size through the regulation of spikelet hull cell division. SG6 encodes a previously uncharacterized PLATZ (plant AT-rich sequence and zinc-binding) protein that is ubiquitously localized throughout the cell and is preferentially expressed in the early developing panicles but not in the endosperm. The overexpression of SG6 resulted in significantly larger and heavier grains, as well as increased plant heights, which is consistent with its elevated spikelet hull cell division rate. Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that SG6 interacts with the core cell cycle machinery DP protein and several other putative cell division regulators, consistent with our transcriptomic analysis, which showed that SG6 activates the expression of many DNA replication and cell-cycle-related genes. These results confirm the crucial role of SG6 in determining grain size by regulating spikelet hull cell division and provide clues for understanding the functions of PLATZ family proteins and the network regulating cereal grain size.
