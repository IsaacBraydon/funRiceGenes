GL6	 The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle |  We demonstrate that GL6 participates in RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcription machinery by interacting with RPC53 and TFC1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development	 The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle
GL6|SG6	 The overexpression of SG6 resulted in significantly larger and heavier grains, as well as increased plant heights, which is consistent with its elevated spikelet hull cell division rate |  Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that SG6 interacts with the core cell cycle machinery DP protein and several other putative cell division regulators, consistent with our transcriptomic analysis, which showed that SG6 activates the expression of many DNA replication and cell-cycle-related genes	 The overexpression of SG6 resulted in significantly larger and heavier grains, as well as increased plant heights, which is consistent with its elevated spikelet hull cell division rate
