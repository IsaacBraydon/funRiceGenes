GL6	 The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle |  We demonstrate that GL6 participates in RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) transcription machinery by interacting with RPC53 and TFC1 to regulate the expression of genes involved in rice grain development	 The null gl6 mutant possesses short grains, whereas overexpression of GL6 results in large grains and decreased grain number per panicle
