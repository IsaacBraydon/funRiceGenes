GS3	PGL1	Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice	 Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants

GS3	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3
GS3	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
