DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses

DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses
GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2	GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses	Furthermore, we found that GSK2, the central negative regulator of rice brassinosteroid signalling, directly interacts with OsGRF4 and inhibits its transcription activation activity to mediate the specific regulation of grain length by the hormone.
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	GW5|qSW5	GW5 acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.	 GW5 protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight)
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Furthermore, we revealed that OFP1 directly interacts with GSK2 kinase, and inhibition of the kinase activity significantly promotes OFP1 protein accumulation in plant
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OsGAMYBL2	A brassinosteroid responsive miRNA-target module regulates gibberellin biosynthesis and plant development.	 Furthermore, OsGSK2, a key negative player in BR signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents it from being degraded under 24-epibrassinolide treatment, whereas SLR1, a rice DELLA protein negatively regulating GA signaling, interacts with OsGAMYBL2 and prevents OsGAMYBL2 from binding to the target gene promoter
