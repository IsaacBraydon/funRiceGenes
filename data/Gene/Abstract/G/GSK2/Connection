DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6	GSK2	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	 Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses| Indeed, GSK2 can interact with DLT and phosphorylate DLT| In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level| These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses
