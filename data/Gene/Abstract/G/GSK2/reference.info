2562.pdf	DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING acts as a direct downstream target of a GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase to mediate brassinosteroid responses in rice	2012	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	In Arabidopsis thaliana, the GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE2 (BIN2) plays a critical role in the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway by negatively regulating the activities of bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1/BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 family transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream BR-responsive genes. In this study, we analyzed the function of a rice (Oryza sativa) GSK3/SHAGGY-like kinase (GSK2), which is one of the orthologs of BIN2. Overexpression of GSK2 (Go) led to plants with typical BR loss-of-function phenotypes, and suppression of GSK2 resulted in enhanced BR signaling phenotypes. DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT) is a positive regulator that mediates several BR responses in rice. Suppression of DLT can enhance the phenotypes of BR receptor mutant d61-1, and overexpression of DLT obviously suppressed the BR loss-of-function phenotypes of both d61-1 and Go, suggesting that DLT functions downstream of GSK2 to modulate BR responses. Indeed, GSK2 can interact with DLT and phosphorylate DLT. Moreover, brassinolide treatment can induce the dephosphorylation of DLT, leading to the accumulation of dephosphorylated DLT protein. In GSK2 transgenic plants, the DLT phosphorylation level is dictated by the GSK2 level. These results demonstrate that DLT is a GSK2 substrate, further reinforcing that the BIN2/GSK2 kinase has multiple substrates that carry out various BR responses.
NA	Natural selection of a GSK3 determines rice mesocotyl domestication by coordinating strigolactone and brassinosteroid signaling.	2018	Nat Commun	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Center of Integrative Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Mesocotyl is the crucial organ for pushing buds out of deep water or soil after germination in monocots. Deep direct seeding or mechanized dry seeding cultivation practice requires rice cultivars having long mesocotyl. However, the mechanisms of mesocotyl elongation and domestication remain unknown. Here, our genome-wide association study (GWAS) reveals that natural variations of OsGSK2, a conserved GSK3-like kinase involved in brassinosteroid signaling, determine rice mesocotyl length variation. Variations in the coding region of OsGSK2 alter its kinase activity. It is selected for mesocotyl length variation during domestication. Molecular analyses show that brassinosteroid-promoted mesocotyl elongation functions by suppressing the phosphorylation of an U-type cyclin, CYC U2, by OsGSK2. Importantly, the F-box protein D3, a major positive component in strigolactone signaling, can degrade the OsGSK2-phosphorylated CYC U2 to inhibit mesocotyl elongation. Together, these results suggest that OsGSK2 is selected to regulate mesocotyl length by coordinating strigolactone and brassinosteroid signaling during domestication.
NA	OsBZR1 turnover mediated by OsSK22-regulated U-box E3 ligase OsPUB24 in rice BR response.	2019	Plant J	Department of Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul, 120-749, Republic of Korea.	OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) is the closest rice homolog of the Arabidopsis BZR1 and BES1 (bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1)/BZR2 transcription factors. OsBZR1 plays a central role in the rice brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Despite its functional importance, the control mechanism by which the cellular stability of OsBZR1 is regulated has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that a rice U-box E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase OsPUB24 acts as a negative regulator in the BR signaling pathway via 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of OsBZR1. The ospub24 T-DNA knock-out mutant and Ubi:RNAi-OsPUB24 knock-down rice plants displayed enhanced seedling growth, increased lamina joint bending, and hypersensitivity to brassinolide (BL). The expressions of the BR biosynthetic genes suppressed by BR in a negative feedback loop were lower in the mutant progeny than in the wild-type rice plants, which indicated increased BR responses in the mutant line. OsPUB24 ubiquitinated OsBZR1, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of OsBZR1. In addition, the stability of OsPUB24 was downregulated by BL and bikinin, an inhibitor of OsSK22 (Oryza sativa Shaggy/GSK3-like kinase 22). OsSK22, the homolog of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) protein kinase, phosphorylated OsPUB24 and elevated the cellular stability of OsPUB24. Our findings suggest that OsPUB24 participates in OsBZR1 turnover and the regulatory networks of OsPUB24, OsSK22, and OsBZR1 are crucial for fine-tuning the BR response in rice.
