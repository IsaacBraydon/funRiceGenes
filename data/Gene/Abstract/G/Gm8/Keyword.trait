Gm8	resistance	Map-based cloning and validation of a gall midge resistance gene, Gm8, encoding a proline-rich protein in the rice variety Aganni.	 The indica rice variety Aganni, a landrace from the state of Kerala, is known to carry the gall midge resistance gene Gm8 with HR-type of resistance
Gm8	resistance	Map-based cloning and validation of a gall midge resistance gene, Gm8, encoding a proline-rich protein in the rice variety Aganni.	 Validation of this gene in five gall midge resistant rice varieties carrying different resistance genes revealed that the induction was unique to Aganni rice carrying Gm8 gene
