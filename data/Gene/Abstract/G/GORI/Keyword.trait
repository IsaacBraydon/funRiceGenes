GORI|OsABT	growth	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.
GORI|OsABT	pollen	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.
GORI|OsABT	pollen	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 GORI encodes a seven-WD40-motif protein that interacts with an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH)-domain protein, which modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and regulates Rac6 activity in the apical plasma membrane of elongating pollen tubes
GORI|OsABT	pollen	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 Loss of function of GORI or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice
GORI|OsABT	pollen	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by GORI overexpression
GORI|OsABT	pollen	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 Our findings demonstrated that the GORI protein is a positive regulator of pollen germination and tube growth, serving as a link between Rac6 activity regulation and ANTH-mediated endocytosis
GORI|OsABT	sterility	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 Loss of function of GORI or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice
GORI|OsABT	plasma membrane	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 GORI encodes a seven-WD40-motif protein that interacts with an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH)-domain protein, which modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and regulates Rac6 activity in the apical plasma membrane of elongating pollen tubes
GORI|OsABT	male sterility	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	 Loss of function of GORI or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice
