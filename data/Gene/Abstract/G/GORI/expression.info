GORI	 In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by GORI overexpression	 In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by GORI overexpression
GORI|OsABT	 Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein, enhanced salt tolerance in rice seedlings by regulating root activity, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2) content, and O(2)(•-) production rate |  Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants |  Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2 |  A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress	 Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein, enhanced salt tolerance in rice seedlings by regulating root activity, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2) content, and O(2)(•-) production rate |  Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants |  Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2 |  A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress
