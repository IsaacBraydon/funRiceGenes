NA	WD40-domain protein GORI is an integrative scaffold that is required for pollen tube growth in rice.	2022	Plant Signal Behav	Department of Life Science and Environmental Biochemistry, Pusan National University, Miryang, Republic of Korea.	The pollen tube plays a critical role in angiosperm plants by delivering sperm gametes for double fertilization. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying pollen tube germination and growth are crucial to crop plants, they are poorly understood. Here, we describe recent advancements in the understanding of the role of the WD40-domain protein in regulating pollen germination and discuss future directions to investigate its role in rice. GORI encodes a seven-WD40-motif protein that interacts with an AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH)-domain protein, which modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and regulates Rac6 activity in the apical plasma membrane of elongating pollen tubes. Loss of function of GORI or Rac6 reduces pollen germination and tube growth, thereby resulting in male sterility in rice. In contrast, overexpression of Rac6 increases pollen tube elongation, with this effect being rescued by GORI overexpression. In the absence of ANTH, pollen germination was reduced, similar to the results observed after inhibitor treatment, indicating that pollen germination partially requires CME. Our findings demonstrated that the GORI protein is a positive regulator of pollen germination and tube growth, serving as a link between Rac6 activity regulation and ANTH-mediated endocytosis.
NA	OsABT Is Involved in Abscisic Acid Signaling Pathway and Salt Tolerance of Roots at the Rice Seedling Stage.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life and Environmental Sciences, Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou 311121, China.	Rice is a staple cereal crop worldwide, and increasing its yields is vital to ensuring global food security. Salinity is a major factor that affects rice yield. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate salt tolerance mechanisms in rice. Proteins containing WD40 repeats play important roles in eukaryotic development and environmental adaptation. Here, we showed that overexpression of OsABT, a gene encoding a WD40-repeat protein, enhanced salt tolerance in rice seedlings by regulating root activity, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde and H(2)O(2) content, and O(2)(â€¢-) production rate. Root ion concentrations indicated that OsABT overexpression lines could maintain lower Na(+) and higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios and upregulated expression of salt-related genes OsSOS1 and OsHAK5 compared with the wild-type (WT) Nipponbare plants. Furthermore, Overexpression of OsABT decreased the abscisic acid (ABA) content, while downregulating the ABA synthesis genes OsNCED3 and OsNCED4 and upregulating the ABA catabolic gene OsABA8ox2. The yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses showed that OsABT interacted with the ABA receptor proteins OsPYL4, OsPYL10, and PP2C phosphatase OsABIL2. A transcriptome analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes between OsABT overexpression lines and WT plants were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, including ABA signaling pathway under salt stress. Thus, OsABT can improve the salt tolerance in rice seedling roots by inhibiting reactive oxygen species accumulation, thereby regulating the intracellular Na(+)/K(+) balance, ABA content, and ABA signaling pathway.
