NA	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	2015	Molecular plant	The State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 310006, China	Grain size determines grain weight and affects grain quality. Several major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) regulating grain size have been cloned; however, our understanding of the underlying mechanism that regulates the size of rice grains remains fragmentary. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator. GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator. A rare mutation of GS2 affecting the binding site for the regulatory microRNA OsmiR396c causes increased expression of GS2/OsGRF4. The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield. The introduction of this rare allele of GS2/OsGRF4 into rice cultivars could enhance grain weight and increase grain yield, with possible applications in breeding high-yield rice varieties.
