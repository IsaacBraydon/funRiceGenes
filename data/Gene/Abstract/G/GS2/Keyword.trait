GS2|OsGRF4	grain size	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
GS2|OsGRF4	grain yield	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
GS2|OsGRF4	transcriptional regulator	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
GS2|OsGRF4	transcription activator	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
GS2|OsGRF4	grain weight	A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice	The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.
