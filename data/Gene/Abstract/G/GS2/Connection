GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2	OSH71|Oskn2	Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.	Conversely, RNA interference silencing of OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF5 resulted in dwarfism, delayed growth and inflorescence formation, and up-regulation of Oskn2
GS2|OsGRF4|GL2|GLW2	GSK2|OsGSK2	Control of grain size and rice yield by GL2-mediated brassinosteroid responses	Furthermore, we found that GSK2, the central negative regulator of rice brassinosteroid signalling, directly interacts with OsGRF4 and inhibits its transcription activation activity to mediate the specific regulation of grain length by the hormone.

In this study, we investigated the effect of concurrent overexpression of the rice cytosolic GS1 (OsGS1;1) and chloroplastic GS2 (OsGS2) genes in transgenic rice on its tolerance to abiotic stresses and the herbicide Glufosinate
