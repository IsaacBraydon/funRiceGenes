GLO1	defense	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	" Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression"
GLO1	transcription factor	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	 We previously described identification of rice GLO1 that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors
GLO1	root	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	 GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root
GLO1	cell death	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	 Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports
GLO1	growth	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	 Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports
