Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiration, catalyzing the oxidation of glycolate to glyoxylate. Arabidopsis GLO is required for nonhost defense responses to Pseudomonas syringae and for tobacco Pto/AvrPto-mediated defense responses. We previously described identification of rice GLO1 that interacts with a glutaredoxin protein, which in turn interacts with TGA transcription factors. TGA transcription factors are well known to participate in NPR1/NH1-mediated defense signaling, which is crucial to systemic acquired resistance in plants. Here we demonstrate that reduction of rice GLO1 expression leads to enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae (Xoo). Constitutive silencing of GLO1 leads to programmed cell death, resulting in a lesion-mimic phenotype and lethality or reduced plant growth and development, consistent with previous reports. Inducible silencing of GLO1, employing a dexamethasone-GVG (Gal4 DNA binding domain-VP16 activation domain-glucocorticoid receptor fusion) inducible system, alleviates these detrimental effects. Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression.
pone.0039658.pdf	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	2012	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Glycolate oxidase (GLO) is a key enzyme in photorespiratory metabolism. Four putative GLO genes were identified in the rice genome, but how each gene member contributes to GLO activities, particularly to its isozyme profile, is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed how each gene plays a role in isozyme formation and enzymatic activities in both yeast cells and rice tissues. Five GLO isozymes were detected in rice leaves. GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root. Enzymatic assays showed that all yeast-expressed GLO members except GLO5 have enzymatic activities. Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5. GLO1/GLO4 co-expressed in yeast exhibited the same isozyme pattern as that from rice leaves. When either GLO1 or GLO4 was silenced, expressions of both genes were simultaneously suppressed and most of the GLO activities were lost, and consistent with this observation, little GLO isozyme protein was detected in the silenced plants. In contrast, no observable effect was detected when GLO3 was suppressed. Comparative analyses between the GLO isoforms expressed in yeast and the isozymes from rice leaves indicated that two of the five isozymes are homo-oligomers composed of either GLO1 or GLO4, and the other three are hetero-oligomers composed of both GLO1 and GLO4. Our current data suggest that GLO isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice, and the existence of GLO isozymes and GLO molecular and compositional complexities implicate potential novel roles for GLO in plants.
NA	A synthetic light-inducible photorespiratory bypass enhances photosynthesis to improve rice growth and grain yield.	2023	Plant Commun	College of Agriculture, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang 471000, China. Electronic address: xhwcyn@163.com.	Bioengineering of photorespiratory bypasses is an effective strategy for improving plant productivity through modulating photosynthesis. In previous work, two photorespiratory bypasses, GOC and GCGT bypass, increased photosynthetic rates while possessing decreased seed setting rate in rice (Oryza sativa), probably due to the excess photosynthate accumulation in the stem. To solve this bottleneck, here, we successfully developed a new synthetic photorespiratory bypass (called GMA bypass) in rice chloroplasts by introducing Oryza sativa glycolate oxidase 1 (OsGLO1), Cucurbita maxima malate synthase (CmMS), and Oryza sativa ascorbate peroxidase7 (OsAPX7) into rice genome using a high-efficiency transgene stacking system. Unlike GOC and GCGT bypass genes driven by constitutive promoters, the expression of OsGLO1 in GMA plants, driven by a light-inducible Rubisco small subunit promoter (pRbcS), was dynamically changed with light and resulted in a moderate increase in photosynthate. Photosynthetic rates in GMA plants were significantly increased, and grain yields were improved significantly under greenhouse and field conditions. Transgenic GMA rice had an unimpaired seed setting rate under both test conditions, different from previous photorespiratory bypass rice, probably contributing to the proper modulating of photorespiratory bypass. All of this is implied that appropriately engineering GMA bypass could enhance rice growth and grain yield without affecting seed setting rate.
