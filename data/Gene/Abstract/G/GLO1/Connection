GLO1	OsNPR1|NH1	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression
GLO1	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	Reduced expression of glycolate oxidase leads to enhanced disease resistance in rice	Silencing of GLO1 results in enhanced resistance to Xoo, increased expression of defense regulators NH1, NH3, and WRKY45, and activation of PR1 expression
GLO1	GLO3	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root
GLO1	GLO3	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	GLO1 and GLO4 are predominately expressed in rice leaves, while GLO3 and GLO5 are mainly expressed in the root
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	Further analyses suggested that GLO1, GLO3 and GLO4 interacted with each other, but no interactions were observed for GLO5
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	GLO1/GLO4 co-expressed in yeast exhibited the same isozyme pattern as that from rice leaves
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	When either GLO1 or GLO4 was silenced, expressions of both genes were simultaneously suppressed and most of the GLO activities were lost, and consistent with this observation, little GLO isozyme protein was detected in the silenced plants
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	Comparative analyses between the GLO isoforms expressed in yeast and the isozymes from rice leaves indicated that two of the five isozymes are homo-oligomers composed of either GLO1 or GLO4, and the other three are hetero-oligomers composed of both GLO1 and GLO4
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	Our current data suggest that GLO isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice, and the existence of GLO isozymes and GLO molecular and compositional complexities implicate potential novel roles for GLO in plants
GLO1	GLO4	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice	Glycolate oxidase isozymes are coordinately controlled by GLO1 and GLO4 in rice
