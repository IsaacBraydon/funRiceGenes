GnT1	seed	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
GnT1	seed	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress
GnT1	reproductive	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	The developmental defects of gnt1 ultimately resulted in early lethality without transition to the reproductive stage
GnT1	salt	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress
GnT1	cell wall	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
GnT1	cytokinin	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	sativa response regulators that are rapidly induced by cytokinins in gnt1 confirmed that cytokinin signaling is impaired in the mutant
GnT1	cellulose	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
GnT1	seedling	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
GnT1	tiller	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content
GnT1	salt stress	N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa	However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress
