GSE5	 We found that loss of GSE5 function caused wide and heavy grains, while overexpression of GSE5 resulted in narrow grains |  We demonstrated that a 950-bp deletion (DEL1) in indica varieties carrying the GSE5(DEL1+IN1) haplotype and a 1212-bp deletion (DEL2) in japonica varieties carrying the GSE5(DEL2) haplotype associated with decreased expression of GSE5, resulting in wide grains	 We found that loss of GSE5 function caused wide and heavy grains, while overexpression of GSE5 resulted in narrow grains
