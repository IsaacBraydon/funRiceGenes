GSE5	OsCam1-1	Natural Variation in the Promoter of GSE5 Contributes to Grain Size Diversity in Rice.	 GSE5 encodes a plasma membrane-associated protein with IQ domains (IQD), which interacts with the rice calmodulin protein, OsCaM1-1
GSE5	OsPUB3	Control of Grain Weight and Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.) by OsPUB3 Encoding a U-Box E3 Ubiquitin Ligase.	 Their differences on grain weight and size were significant in the background of non-functional gse5, but non-significant in the background of functional GSE5, indicating a genetic interaction between OsPUB3 and GSE5
