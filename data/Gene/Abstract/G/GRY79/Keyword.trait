GRY79	seedling	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.
GRY79	seedling	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.	The green - revertible yellow79 mutant resulting from a single-base mutation suggested that the GRY79 gene encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice
GRY79	seedling	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.	 Therefore, we have confirmed that the gry79 mutant phenotype resulted from a single-base mutation in GRY79 (Os02g33610) gene, suggesting that the gene encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice
GRY79	chloroplast	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.	GRY79 encoding a putative metallo-¦Â-lactamase-trihelix chimera is involved in chloroplast development at early seedling stage of rice.
