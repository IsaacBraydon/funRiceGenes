NA	GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 (GSL5) plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Haidian District, Zhongguancun South Street, No. 12, Beijing 100081, China.	Callose plays an important role in pollen development in flowering plants. In rice, ten genes encoding putative callose synthases have been identified; however, none of them has been functionally characterized. In this study, a rice Glucan Synthase-Like 5 (GSL5) knock-out mutant was isolated that exhibited a severe reduction in fertility. Pollen viability tests indicated that the pollen of the mutant was abnormal while the embryo sac was normal. Further, GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants phenocopied the gsl5 mutant. The RNA expression of GSL5 was found to be knocked out in the gsl5 mutant and knocked known in GSL5-RNA interference transgenic plants by real-time RT-PCR analysis. The male sterility of the mutant was due to abnormal microspore development; an analysis of paraffin sections of the mutant anthers at various developmental stages revealed that abnormal microspore development began in late meiosis. Both the knock-out and knock-down of GSL5 caused a lack of callose in the primary cell wall of meiocytes and in the cell plate of tetrads. As a result, the callose wall of the microspores was defective. This was demonstrated by aniline blue staining and an immunogold labeling assay; the microspores could not maintain their shape, leading to premature swelling and even collapsed microspores. These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice.
NA	Rice GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE5 promotes anther callose deposition to maintain meiosis initiation and progression.	2022	Plant Physiol	Plant Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Gene Function and Phenomics, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.	Callose is a plant cell wall polysaccharide whose deposition is spatiotemporally regulated in various developmental processes and environmental stress responses. The appearance of callose in premeiotic anthers is a prominent histological hallmark for the onset of meiosis in flowering plants; however, the biological role of callose in meiosis remains unknown. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) GLUCAN SYNTHASE LIKE5 (OsGSL5), a callose synthase, localizes on the plasma membrane of pollen mother cells (PMCs) and is responsible for biogenesis of callose in anther locules through premeiotic and meiotic stages. In Osgsl5 mutant anthers mostly lacking callose deposition, aberrant PMCs accompanied by aggregated, unpaired, or multivalent chromosomes were frequently observed and, furthermore, a considerable number of mutant PMCs had untimely progress into meiosis compared to that of wild-type PMCs. Immunostaining of meiosis-specific protein HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS2 in premeiotic PMCs revealed precocious meiosis entry in Osgsl5 anthers. These findings provide insights into the function of callose in controlling the timing of male meiosis initiation and progression, in addition to roles in microsporogenesis, in flowering plants.
