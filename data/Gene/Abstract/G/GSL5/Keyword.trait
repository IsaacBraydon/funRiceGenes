GSL5|OsGSL5	meiosis	GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 (GSL5) plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.	These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
GSL5|OsGSL5	fertility	GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 (GSL5) plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.	These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice
GSL5|OsGSL5	microspore	GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE 5 (GSL5) plays an essential role in male fertility by regulating callose metabolism during microsporogenesis in rice.	These data suggest that the callose synthase encoded by GSL5 plays a vital role in microspore development during late meiosis and is essential for male fertility in rice

GSL5|OsGSL5	meiosis	Rice GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE5 promotes anther callose deposition to maintain meiosis initiation and progression.	 In Osgsl5 mutant anthers mostly lacking callose deposition, aberrant PMCs accompanied by aggregated, unpaired, or multivalent chromosomes were frequently observed and, furthermore, a considerable number of mutant PMCs had untimely progress into meiosis compared to that of wild-type PMCs
GSL5|OsGSL5	meiosis	Rice GLUCAN SYNTHASE-LIKE5 promotes anther callose deposition to maintain meiosis initiation and progression.	 Immunostaining of meiosis-specific protein HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS2 in premeiotic PMCs revealed precocious meiosis entry in Osgsl5 anthers
