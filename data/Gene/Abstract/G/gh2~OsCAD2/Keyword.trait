GH2|OsCAD2	sheath	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
GH2|OsCAD2	panicle	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice	Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
GH2|OsCAD2	root	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
GH2|OsCAD2	root	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice	Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
GH2|OsCAD2	culm	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm
GH2|OsCAD2	cellulose	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction analyses of rice cell walls revealed that and OsCAD2 deficiencies contributed to the disruptions of the cellulose crystalline network
GH2|OsCAD2	cellulose	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 Further, OsCAldOMT1 deficiency contributed to the increase of the cellulose molecular mobility more prominently than OsCAD2 deficiency, resulting in apparently more loosened lignocellulose molecular assembly
GH2|OsCAD2	cell wall	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 A set of rice mutants harboring knockout mutations in either or both OsCAldOMT1 and OsCAD2 was generated in part by genome editing and subjected to comparative cell wall chemical and supramolecular structure analyses
GH2|OsCAD2	cell wall	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray diffraction analyses of rice cell walls revealed that and OsCAD2 deficiencies contributed to the disruptions of the cellulose crystalline network
