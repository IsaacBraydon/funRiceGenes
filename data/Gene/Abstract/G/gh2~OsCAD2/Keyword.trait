GH2|OsCAD2	sheath	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	 Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
GH2|OsCAD2	panicle	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice	 Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
GH2|OsCAD2	root	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	 Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin
GH2|OsCAD2	root	GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 encodes a primarily multifunctional cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase in rice	 Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity
GH2|OsCAD2	culm	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm	OsCAD2 is the major CAD gene responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice culm
