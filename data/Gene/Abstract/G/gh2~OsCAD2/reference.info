Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the last step of monolignol biosynthesis. The rice genome contains 12 CAD-like genes, and whereas the proteins encoded by OsCAD2 and OsCAD7 are known to function in monolignol biosynthesis, the degree to which these enzymes contribute to this process and the involvement of the enzymes encoded by the remaining ten genes is unclear. This paper investigates the role of OsCAD2 and the nine other OsCAD-like proteins in monolignol biosynthesis. Among the OsCAD genes analyzed, OsCAD2, an enzyme belonging to the bona fide CAD phylogenetic group, was the most abundantly expressed gene in the uppermost internode, and was expressed at levels that were more than seven times greater than those of the second most abundantly expressed gene, OsCAD1. Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin. Furthermore, expression always preceded lignin accumulation, showing the tight correlation between OsCAD2 expression and monolignol biosynthesis. Additionally, expression of pCAD::GUS was well synchronized with that of rice caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT::GUS), suggesting that the two enzymes function cooperatively during monolignol biosynthesis. Co-expression network analysis of eight OsCAD genes further revealed that, among the OsCAD genes, expression of OsCAD2 was most tightly associated with the transcription of lignin biosynthesis-related genes. These results suggest that OsCAD2 is largely responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice, which is similar to that indicated for the predominant role of other plant bona fide CAD protein to monolignol biosynthesis.

Cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) is an enzyme important in lignin biosynthesis. The rice genome contains 12 distinct genes present at nine different loci that encode products with significant similarity to CAD. The rice gene family is diverse with respect to other angiosperm and gymnosperm CAD genes isolated to date and includes one member (OsCAD6) that contains a peroxisomal targeting signal and is substantially diverged relative to other family members. Four closely related family members (OsCAD8A-D) are present at the same locus and represent the product of a localized gene duplication and inversion. Promoter-reporter gene fusions to OsCAD2, an orthologue of the CAD gene present at the bm1 (brown midrib 1) locus of maize, reveal that in rice expression is associated with vascular tissue in aerial parts of the plant and is correlated with the onset of lignification. In root tissue, expression is primarily in the cortical parenchyma adjacent to the exodermis and in vascular tissue.

Lignin content and composition are two important agronomic traits for the utilization of agricultural residues. Rice (Oryza sativa) gold hull and internode phenotype is a classical morphological marker trait that has long been applied to breeding and genetics study. In this study, we have cloned the GOLD HULL AND INTERNODE2 (GH2) gene in rice using a map-based cloning approach. The result shows that the gh2 mutant is a lignin-deficient mutant, and GH2 encodes a cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). Consistent with this finding, extracts from roots, internodes, hulls, and panicles of the gh2 plants exhibited drastically reduced CAD activity and undetectable sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activity. When expressed in Escherichia coli, purified recombinant GH2 was found to exhibit strong catalytic ability toward coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde, while the mutant protein gh2 completely lost the corresponding CAD and sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Further phenotypic analysis of the gh2 mutant plants revealed that the p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and sinapyl monomers were reduced in almost the same ratio compared to the wild type. Our results suggest GH2 acts as a primarily multifunctional CAD to synthesize coniferyl and sinapyl alcohol precursors in rice lignin biosynthesis.
NA	Increased lodging resistance in long-culm, low-lignin gh2 rice for improved feed and bioenergy production	2014	Sci Rep	Institute of Agriculture, Graduate School, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Fuchu, Tokyo 183-8509, Japan.	Lignin modification has been a breeding target for the improvements of forage digestibility and energy yields in forage and bioenergy crops, but decreased lignin levels are often accompanied by reduced lodging resistance. The rice mutant gold hull and internode2 (gh2) has been identified to be lignin deficient. GH2 has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2 and encodes cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD). We developed a long-culm variety, 'Leaf Star', with superior lodging resistance and a gh phenotype similar to one of its parents, 'Chugoku 117'. The gh loci in Leaf Star and Chugoku 117 were localized to the same region of chromosome 2 as the gh2 mutant. Leaf Star had culms with low lignin concentrations due to a natural mutation in OsCAD2 that was not present in Chugoku 117. However, this variety had high culm strength due to its strong, thick culms. Additionally, this variety had a thick layer of cortical fiber tissue with well-developed secondary cell walls. Our results suggest that rice can be improved for forage and bioenergy production by combining superior lodging resistance, which can be obtained by introducing thick and stiff culm traits, with low lignin concentrations, which can be obtained using the gh2 variety.
NA	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which a subset of genes express dependent on the origin of their parents. In plants, it is unclear whether imprinted genes are conserved between subspecies in rice. Here we identified imprinted genes from embryo and endosperm 5-7 days after pollination from three pairs of reciprocal hybrids, including inter-subspecies, japonica intra-subspecies, and indica intra-subspecies reciprocal hybrids. A total of 914 imprinted genes, including 546 in inter-subspecies hybrids, 211 in japonica intra-subspecies hybrids, and 286 in indica intra-subspecies hybrids. In general, the number of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) is more than paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Moreover, imprinted genes tend to be in mini clusters. The number of shared genes by R9N (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Nipponbare) and R9Z (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Zhenshan 97), R9N and RZN (reciprocal crosses between Zhonghua11 and Nipponbare), R9Z and RZN was 72, 46, and 16. These genes frequently involved in energy metabolism and seed development. Five imprinted genes (Os01g0151700, Os07g0103100, Os10g0340600, Os11g0679700, and Os12g0632800) are commonly detected in all three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and were validated by RT-PCR sequencing. Gene editing of two imprinted genes revealed that both genes conferred grain filling. Moreover, 15 and 27 imprinted genes with diverse functions in rice were shared with Arabidopsis and maize, respectively. This study provided valuable resources for identification of imprinting genes in rice or even in cereals.
NA	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of South China Agricultural Plant Molecular Analysis and Genetic Improvement, and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Applied Botany, South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	The plant cell wall provides mechanical strength to support plant growth and development and to determine plant architecture. Cellulose and mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) present in primary cell wall, whereas cellulose, lignin and hemicellulose exist in secondary cell wall. Biosynthesis of the cell wall biopolymers needs the coordinated transcriptional regulation of all the biosynthetic genes. The module of OsmiR166b-OsHox32 regulates expression levels of the genes related to biosynthesis of MLG, cellulose and lignin. Transgenic plants knocking down miR166b (STTM166b) by short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology or overexpressing OsHox32 (OEHox32) showed drooping leaves and brittle culms. Due to accumulation of less lignin and cellulose, the cell wall thickness of STTM166b and OEHox32 plants was reduced when compared to that of wild-type plants. Overexpression of miR166b (OE166b) in rice plants or knocking down of OsHox32 by RNA interference (RNAiHox32) led to increased thickness of cell walls and enhanced mechanical strength of culms. Molecular analyses showed that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair regulates cell wall-related gene expression. OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes. The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15). OsHox32 interacts with OSH15, and the START domain of OsHox32, harbouring the miR166b cleavage site, is required for the interaction of these two proteins. Our results demonstrate that OsmiR166b-OsHox32 pair plays important roles not only in plant growth and development but also in plant architecture by regulating the cell wall-related gene expression.
