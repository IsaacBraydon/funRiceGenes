GH2|OsCAD2	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 OsHox32 binds to the promoters of OsCAD2 and OsCESA7 to suppress the expression levels of these two genes
GH2|OsCAD2	OSHB4|OsHox32	The OsmiRNA166b-OsHox32 pair regulates mechanical strength of rice plants by modulating cell wall biosynthesis	 The suppression of OsCAD2 is synergistic when OsHox32 is co-expressed with OSH15 (Oryza sativa homeobox 15)
