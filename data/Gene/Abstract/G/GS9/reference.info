NA	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	2018	Nat Commun	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education/Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology of Jiangsu Province, College of Agriculture, Yangzhou University, 225009, Yangzhou, China.	Identification of grain shape determining genes can facilitate breeding of rice cultivars with optimal grain shape and appearance quality. Here, we identify GS9 (Grain Shape Gene on Chromosome 9) gene by map-based cloning. The gs9 null mutant has slender grains, while overexpression GS9 results in round grains. GS9 encodes a protein without known conserved functional domain. It regulates grain shape by altering cell division. The interaction of GS9 and ovate family proteins OsOFP14 and OsOFP8 is modulated by OsGSK2 kinase, a key regulator of the brassinosteroids signaling pathway. Genetic interaction analysis reveals that GS9 functions independently from other previously identified grain size genes. Introducing the gs9 allele into elite rice cultivars significantly improves grain shape and appearance quality. It suggests potential application of gs9, alone or in combination with other grain size determining genes, in breeding of rice varieties with optimized grain shape.
NA	Targeted manipulation of grain shape genes effectively improves outcrossing rate and hybrid seed production in rice.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, 510642, Guangzhou, China.	Stigma exsertion rate (SER) of the male sterile line is a key limiting factor for hybrid seed production in rice. Although a large number of quantitative trait loci associated with SER have been reported, few genes have been molecularly cloned and functionally characterized, severely hindering the genetic improvement of SER of the male sterile line and the breeding efficiency of hybrid rice. In this study, we identified three grain shape regulatory genes, GS3, GW8 and GS9, as potential candidate genes for targeted manipulation of grain shape and SER. We show that simultaneously knocking out these three genes could effectively increase SER by increasing the ratio of spikelet length/spikelet width and length of stigma and style, without negative impacts on other agronomic traits. Cellular examination and transcriptomic analyses revealed a role of these genes in coordinated regulation of transverse and longitudinal cell division in the pistils. Moreover, we demonstrate that targeted manipulation of these grain shape genes could significantly improve the outcrossing rate in both the ZH11 (a japonica variety) and Zhu6S (an indica male sterile line) backgrounds. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of rice SER regulation and develop an effective strategy to improve SER and out-crossing rate in rice, thus facilitating hybrid rice production.
