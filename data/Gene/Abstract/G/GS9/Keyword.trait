GS9	grain	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.
GS9	grain	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	 Genetic interaction analysis reveals that GS9 functions independently from other previously identified grain size genes
GS9	grain	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	 Introducing the gs9 allele into elite rice cultivars significantly improves grain shape and appearance quality
GS9	map-based cloning	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	 Here, we identify GS9 (Grain Shape Gene on Chromosome 9) gene by map-based cloning
GS9	grain size	GS9 acts as a transcriptional activator to regulate rice grain shape and appearance quality.	 Genetic interaction analysis reveals that GS9 functions independently from other previously identified grain size genes
