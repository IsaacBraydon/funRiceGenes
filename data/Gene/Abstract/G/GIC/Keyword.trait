GIC	growth	A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.	 Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage
GIC	seed	A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.	 Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage
GIC	reproductive	A Mutation in GIANT CHLOROPLAST Encoding a PARC6 Homologue Affects Spikelet Fertility in Rice.	 Characterization of gic phenotypes in a rice field showed that gic exhibited defective growth in seed setting, suggesting that the gic mutant negatively affects the reproductive stage
