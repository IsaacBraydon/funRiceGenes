GLR3.1	root apical meristem	A rice glutamate receptor-like gene is critical for the division and survival of individual cells in the root apical meristem.	A rice glutamate receptor-like gene is critical for the division and survival of individual cells in the root apical meristem.
GLR3.1	root apical meristem	A rice glutamate receptor-like gene is critical for the division and survival of individual cells in the root apical meristem.	Our results supply genetic evidence that a plant Glu receptor-like gene, rice GLR3.1, is essential for the maintenance of cell division and individual cell survival in the root apical meristem at the early seedling stage.
GLR3.1	cell division	A rice glutamate receptor-like gene is critical for the division and survival of individual cells in the root apical meristem.	Our results supply genetic evidence that a plant Glu receptor-like gene, rice GLR3.1, is essential for the maintenance of cell division and individual cell survival in the root apical meristem at the early seedling stage.
