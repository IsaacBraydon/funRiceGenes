Glu receptors are known to function as Glu-activated ion channels that mediate mostly excitatory neurotransmission in animals. Glu receptor-like genes have also been reported in higher plants, although their function is largely unknown. We have identified a rice (Oryza sativa) Glu receptor-like gene, designated GLR3.1, in which mutation by T-DNA insertion caused a short-root mutant phenotype. Histology and DNA synthesis analyses revealed that the mutant root meristematic activity is distorted and is accompanied by enhanced programmed cell death. Our results supply genetic evidence that a plant Glu receptor-like gene, rice GLR3.1, is essential for the maintenance of cell division and individual cell survival in the root apical meristem at the early seedling stage.
