GW5|qSW5	cell division	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight	Together, our results suggest that GW5 represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development
GW5|qSW5	grain width	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight	We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5
GW5|qSW5	grain width	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight	To gain a better understanding of how GW5 controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24
GW5|qSW5	grain width	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight	Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight
GW5|qSW5	flower	Deletion in a gene associated with grain size increased yields during rice domestication	Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in qSW5 resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice grains
