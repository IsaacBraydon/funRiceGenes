GW2	GW5|qSW5	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	GW5|qSW5	GW5 acts in the brassinosteroid signalling pathway to regulate grain width and weight in rice.	 GW5 protein is localized to the plasma membrane and can physically interact with and repress the kinase activity of rice GSK2 (glycogen synthase kinase 2), a homologue of Arabidopsis BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE2) kinase, resulting in accumulation of unphosphorylated OsBZR1 (Oryza sativa BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1) and DLT (DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING) proteins in the nucleus to mediate brassinosteroid (BR)-responsive gene expression and growth responses (including grain width and weight)
