GF14b|OsGF14b	 In comparison with wild type (WT), the osgf14b mutant exhibited improved resistance to drought and osmotic stress by changing the content of stress-relevant parameters, complementation of the osgf14b mutant restored the drought sensitivity to WT levels, whereas the OsGF14b-overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress |  The osgf14b mutant plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), while the OsGF14b-overexpression plants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA |  Furthermore, mutation and overexpression of OsGF14b affected the expression of stress-related genes under normal growth conditions and/or drought stress conditions	 In comparison with wild type (WT), the osgf14b mutant exhibited improved resistance to drought and osmotic stress by changing the content of stress-relevant parameters, complementation of the osgf14b mutant restored the drought sensitivity to WT levels, whereas the OsGF14b-overexpression lines exhibited enhanced sensitivity to drought and osmotic stress |  The osgf14b mutant plants were hypersensitive to abscisic acid (ABA), while the OsGF14b-overexpression plants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA |  Furthermore, mutation and overexpression of OsGF14b affected the expression of stress-related genes under normal growth conditions and/or drought stress conditions
GF14b|OsGF14b	 Moreover, the overexpression of OsGF14b in WYJ8 (carrying the qpe9-1 allele) partially increased primary root length under LP conditions	 Moreover, the overexpression of OsGF14b in WYJ8 (carrying the qpe9-1 allele) partially increased primary root length under LP conditions
GF14b|OsGF14b	 Under salt stress, the OsPLC1 protein level in osgf14b was lower than the corresponding value of WT, whereas overexpression of OsGF14b results in a significant increase of OsPLC1 stability	 Under salt stress, the OsPLC1 protein level in osgf14b was lower than the corresponding value of WT, whereas overexpression of OsGF14b results in a significant increase of OsPLC1 stability
