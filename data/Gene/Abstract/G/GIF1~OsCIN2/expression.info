GIF1|OsCIN2|OsGIF1	 We previously showed that upregulation of OsGIF1 expression improves rice grain size |  Overexpression and functional knock-out via a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy revealed that OsGIF1 not only positively regulates the sizes of rice leaf, stem, and grain but also influences rice reproduction |  Expression profiles based on both qRT-PCR and GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) histochemical staining suggested that OsGIF1 is differentially expressed across various rice tissues, consistent with its roles in regulating the development of multiple rice organs	 Overexpression and functional knock-out via a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy revealed that OsGIF1 not only positively regulates the sizes of rice leaf, stem, and grain but also influences rice reproduction
