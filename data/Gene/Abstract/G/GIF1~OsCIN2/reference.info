BACKGROUND: Various evolutionary models have been proposed to interpret the fate of paralogous duplicates, which provides substrates on which evolution selection could act. In particular, domestication, as a special selection, has played important role in crop cultivation with divergence of many genes controlling important agronomic traits. Recent studies have indicated that a pair of duplicate genes was often sub-functionalized from their ancestral functions held by the parental genes. We previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase (CWI) gene GIF1 that plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the promoter region. Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function through independent selection. RESULTS: Through synteny analysis, we show that GIF1 and another cell-wall invertase gene OsCIN1 were paralogues derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses. Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region. GIF1 and OsCIN1 have evolved into different expression patterns and probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity. Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other unrecognized biological process. CONCLUSION: How gene duplication and divergence contribute to genetic novelty and morphological adaptation has been an interesting issue to geneticists and biologists. Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop. Our results also further support the established hypothesis that gene duplication with sub-functionalization could be one solution for genetic adaptive conflict.
mpp12078.pdf	Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice	2014	Mol Plant Pathol	College of Agriculture and Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, 310058, China; National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and National Center of Plant Gene Research, Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Sugar metabolism and sugar signalling are not only critical for plant growth and development, but are also important for stress responses. However, how sugar homeostasis is involved in plant defence against pathogen attack in the model crop rice remains largely unknown. In this study, we observed that the grains of gif1, a loss-of-function mutant of the cell wall invertase gene GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1), were hypersusceptible to postharvest fungal pathogens, with decreased levels of sugars and a thinner glume cell wall in comparison with the wild-type. Interestingly, constitutive expression of GIF1 enhanced resistance to both the rice bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. The GIF1-overexpressing (GIF1-OE) plants accumulated higher levels of glucose, fructose and sucrose compared with the wild-type plants. More importantly, higher levels of callose were deposited in GIF1-OE plants during pathogen infection. Moreover, the cell wall was much thicker in the infection sites of the GIF1-OE plants when compared with the wild-type plants. We also found that defence-related genes were constitutively activated in the GIF1-OE plants. Taken together, our study reveals that sugar homeostasis mediated by GIF1 plays an important role in constitutive and induced physical and chemical defence.
ng.220.pdf	Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication	2008	Nat Genet	Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 300 Fenglin Road, Shanghai 200032, China.	Grain-filling, an important trait that contributes greatly to grain weight, is regulated by quantitative trait loci and is associated with crop domestication syndrome. However, the genes and underlying molecular mechanisms controlling crop grain-filling remain elusive. Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of the rice GIF1 (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1) gene that encodes a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling. The cultivated GIF1 gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain-filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene's regulatory sequence through domestication. Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice GIF1 is responsible for grain weight reduction. Ectopic expression of the cultivated GIF1 gene with the 35S or rice Waxy promoter resulted in smaller grains, whereas overexpression of GIF1 driven by its native promoter increased grain production. These findings, together with the domestication signature that we identified by comparing nucleotide diversity of the GIF1 loci between cultivated and wild rice, strongly suggest that GIF1 is a potential domestication gene and that such a domestication-selected gene can be used for further crop improvement.
NA	OsGIF1 Positively Regulates the Sizes of Stems, Leaves, and Grains in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	Growth-regulating factor (GRF) interacting factors (GIFs) are involved in several developmental processes in Arabidopsis. We previously showed that upregulation of OsGIF1 expression improves rice grain size. However, whether OsGIF1 is involved in other developmental processes remains unclear. Here, we report pleiotropic effects of OsGIF1 on rice organ size regulation. Overexpression and functional knock-out via a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy revealed that OsGIF1 not only positively regulates the sizes of rice leaf, stem, and grain but also influences rice reproduction. Expression profiles based on both qRT-PCR and GUS (¦Â-glucuronidase) histochemical staining suggested that OsGIF1 is differentially expressed across various rice tissues, consistent with its roles in regulating the development of multiple rice organs. Additionally, we found that OsGIF1-GFP localized preferentially in the nucleus, which supports its proposed role as a transcriptional cofactor. Further histological analysis suggested that OsGIF1 affected rice organ size possibly by regulating cell size. Our results suggest that OsGIF1 plays important roles in vegetative and reproductive developmental processes, with important implications for rice breeding.
NA	WB1, a Regulator of Endosperm Development in Rice, Is Identified by a Modified MutMap Method.	2018	Int J Mol Sci	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research, State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, Zhejiang, China. wjiyinh@126.com.	Abnormally developed endosperm strongly affects rice (Oryza sativa) appearance quality and grain weight. Endosperm formation is a complex process, and although many enzymes and related regulators have been identified, many other related factors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a recessive mutation of White Belly 1 (WB1), which regulates rice endosperm development, using a modified MutMap method in the rice mutant wb1. The wb1 mutant develops a white-belly endosperm and abnormal starch granules in the inner portion of white grains. Representative of the white-belly phenotype, grains of wb1 showed a higher grain chalkiness rate and degree and a lower 1000-grain weight (decreased by ~34%), in comparison with that of Wild Type (WT). The contents of amylose and amylopectin in wb1 significantly decreased, and its physical properties were also altered. We adopted the modified MutMap method to identify 2.52 Mb candidate regions with a high specificity, where we detected 275 SNPs in chromosome 4. Finally, we identified 19 SNPs at 12 candidate genes. Transcript levels analysis of all candidate genes showed that WB1 (Os04t0413500), encoding a cell-wall invertase, was the most probable cause of white-belly endosperm phenotype. Switching off WB1 with the CRISPR/cas9 system in Japonica cv. Nipponbare demonstrates that WB1 regulates endosperm development and that different mutations of WB1 disrupt its biological function. All of these results taken together suggest that the wb1 mutant is controlled by the mutation of WB1, and that the modified MutMap method is feasible to identify mutant genes, and could promote genetic improvement in rice.
