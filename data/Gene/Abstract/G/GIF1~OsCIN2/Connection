GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function through independent selection
GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 RESULTS: Through synteny analysis, we show that GIF1 and another cell-wall invertase gene OsCIN1 were paralogues derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses
GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region
GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 GIF1 and OsCIN1 have evolved into different expression patterns and probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity
GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other unrecognized biological process
GIF1|OsCIN2	OsCIN1	Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication	 Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop

GIF1|OsCIN2	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Rice seed size is an important agronomic trait in determining the yield potential, and four seed size related genes (GS3, GW2, qSW5/GW5 and GIF1) have been cloned in rice so far
GIF1|OsCIN2	GW2	Seed size is determined by the combinations of the genes controlling different seed characteristics in rice.	Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3
