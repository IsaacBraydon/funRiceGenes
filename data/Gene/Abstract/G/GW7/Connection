GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	qGW8|OsSPL16|GW8	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	OsMADS34|PAP2	Regulatory Role of OsMADS34 in the Determination of Glumes Fate, Grain Yield, and Quality in Rice.	Interesting, transcriptional activity analysis revealed that OsMADS34 protein was a transcription repressor and it may influence grain yield by suppressing the expressions of BG1, GW8, GW2, and GL7 in the m34-z mutant
GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	OsNF-YC10	OsNF-YC10, a seed preferentially expressed gene regulates grain width by affecting cell proliferation in rice.	 OsNF-YC10 was further revealed to influence the expression of GW8 (a positive regulator of grain width), GW7 (a negative regulator of grain width) and cell cycle-regulated genes CYCD4, CYCA2
Chalk5|VPP5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles
Chalk5|VPP5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8
GW5|qSW5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles
Chalk5|VPP5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.
Chalk5|VPP5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	 Three allele-specific markers for Chalk7, and two other grain genes (GS3 and Chalk5) were developed, and used to stack the desirable alleles at these loci
GS3	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.

BC12|GDD1|YD1|LGW	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Low grain weight, a new allele of BRITTLE CULM12, affects grain size through regulating GW7 expression in rice.	 Elevating the GW7 expression levels in lgw plants rescued the small grain size phenotype
BC12|GDD1|YD1|LGW	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Low grain weight, a new allele of BRITTLE CULM12, affects grain size through regulating GW7 expression in rice.	 We conclude that LGW regulates grain development by directly binding to the GW7 promoter and activating its expression
