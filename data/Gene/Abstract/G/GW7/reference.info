The deployment of heterosis in the form of hybrid rice varieties has boosted grain yield, but grain quality improvement still remains a challenge. Here we show that a quantitative trait locus for rice grain quality, qGW7, reflects allelic variation of GW7, a gene encoding a TONNEAU1-recruiting motif protein with similarity to C-terminal motifs of the human centrosomal protein CAP350. Upregulation of GW7 expression was correlated with the production of more slender grains, as a result of increased cell division in the longitudinal direction and decreased cell division in the transverse direction. OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression. The presence of a semidominant GW7(TFA) allele from tropical japonica rice was associated with higher grain quality without the yield penalty imposed by the Basmati gw8 allele. Manipulation of the OsSPL16-GW7 module thus represents a new strategy to simultaneously improve rice yield and grain quality.
NA	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	2015	Nat Genet	1] State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.

Copy number variants (CNVs) are associated with changes in gene expression levels and contribute to various adaptive traits. Here we show that a CNV at the Grain Length on Chromosome 7 (GL7) locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice (Oryza sativa L.). GL7 encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana LONGIFOLIA proteins, which regulate longitudinal cell elongation. Tandem duplication of a 17.1-kb segment at the GL7 locus leads to upregulation of GL7 and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality. Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of GL7 and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the GL7 locus was selected for and used in breeding. Our work suggests that pyramiding beneficial alleles of GL7 and other yield- and quality-related genes may improve the breeding of elite rice varieties.
NA	Natural Variations in SLG7 Regulate Grain Shape in Rice.	2015	Genetics	Yangzhou University;	Rice (Oryza sativa) grain shape, which is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), has a strong effect on yield production and quality. However, the molecular basis for grain development remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a novel QTL, Slender grain on chromosome 7 (SLG7) that is responsible for grain shape, using backcross introgression lines derived from 9311 and Azucena. The SLG7 allele from Azucena produces longer and thinner grains, while has no influence on grain weight and yield production. SLG7 encodes a protein homologous to LONGIFOLIA 1 and LONGIFOLIA 2, both of which increase organ length in Arabidopsis. SLG7 is constitutively expressed in various tissues in rice, and the SLG7 protein is located in plasma membrane. Morphological and cellular analyses suggested that SLG7 produces slender grains by longitudinally increasing cell length, while transversely decreasing cell width, which is independent from cell division. Our findings show that the functions of SLG7 family members are conserved across monocots and dicots, and the SLG7 allele could be applied in breeding to modify rice grain appearance.
NA	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	2020	J Adv Res	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agriculture University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Introduction: The multiparental population provides us the chance to identify superior alleles controlling a trait for genetic improvement. Genome wide association studies at bin level (bin-GWAS) are expected to be more power in QTL mapping than GWAS at SNP level (SNP-GWAS).  Objectives: This study is to estimate genetic effects of QTL conferring grain appearance quality in rice by SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS, compare their power in QTL mapping and identify the superior alleles of all detected QTL from 4 parents for genetic improvement.  Methods: A 4-way MAGIC population and its four founders were cultivated in two environments to dissect the genetic basis of rice grain appearance quality. Both SNP-GWAS and bin-GWAS were conducted for QTL mapping. Multiple comparison among 4 parental bin/alleles was used to identify the superior alleles.  Results: A total of 16 and 20 QTL associated with grain appearance quality were identified by SNP- and bin-GWAS, respectively. A minor chalkiness QTL qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 was assigned to a 30-kb genomic region, in which OsMH_08T0121900 is the potential candidate gene because its encoded protein, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidase precursor is involved in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway. The superior parental alleles for GS3, GL3.1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles. The top five recombinant inbred lines with the highest quality of grain shape and chalkiness traits all carried gene combinations of superior alleles.  Conclusions: Both SNP- and bin-GWAS methods are encouraged for joint QTL mapping with MAGIC population. qPGWC8.2/qDEC8 is a novel candidate gene strongly associated with chalkiness. The superior alleles of GS3, GW5, GL3.1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8.2 were identified, and the pyramiding of these superior alleles is helpful to improve rice appearance quality.

NA	Development of a specific molecular marker for SLG7 on high-quality rice breeding.	2021	J Genet	Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Crop Germplasm and Genetic Improvement, Food Crops Institute, Hubei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wuhan 430064, People&#39;s Republic of China 13971364609@163.com.	In recent years, the long-grain shape has been found as a new desired quality trait in the breeding of rice in China. The SLG7 gene is a novel gene responsible for slender grain shape in rice. So far, not much information is known regarding the functional molecular markers of SLG7. In this study, a functional marker M-SLG7 for the 11-bp deletion of promoter region of SLG7 was developed. Specificity and applicability of the marker were verified by 60 core breeding accessions and two breeding populations. The accessions, which possessed the SLG7 allele with 11-bp deletion in the promoter region, had longer grain length and better quality. Here, we recommend the use of the simple, inexpensive assay for routine genotyping of slender grain and lower chalkiness in the breeding population for discrimination of SLG7 genotype in rice germplasm.
NA	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	2022	Plants (Basel)	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Grain quality is a key determinant of commercial value in rice. Efficiently improving grain quality, without compromising grain yield, is a challenge in rice breeding programs. Here we report on the identification and application of a grain quality gene, Chalk7, which causes a slender shape and decreases grain chalkiness in rice. Three allele-specific markers for Chalk7, and two other grain genes (GS3 and Chalk5) were developed, and used to stack the desirable alleles at these loci. The effects of individual or combined alleles at the loci were evaluated using a set of near-isogenic lines, each containing one to three favorable alleles in a common background of an elite variety. We found that the favorable allele combination of the three loci, which rarely occurs in natural rice germplasm, greatly reduces chalky grains without negatively impacting on grain yield. The data for newly developed allele-specific markers and pre-breeding lines will facilitate the improvement of grain appearance quality in rice.
