GW7	grain	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7	transcription factor	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7	cell division	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 Upregulation of GW7 expression was correlated with the production of more slender grains, as a result of increased cell division in the longitudinal direction and decreased cell division in the transverse direction
GW7	grain width	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
