GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7|GL7|SLG7	transcription factor	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7|GL7|SLG7	cell division	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 Upregulation of GW7 expression was correlated with the production of more slender grains, as a result of increased cell division in the longitudinal direction and decreased cell division in the transverse direction
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain width	The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.	 OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	1-kb segment at the GL7 locus leads to upregulation of GL7 and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	 Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of GL7 and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the GL7 locus was selected for and used in breeding
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain size	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain size	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	 Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of GL7 and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the GL7 locus was selected for and used in breeding
GW7|GL7|SLG7	grain length	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	1-kb segment at the GL7 locus leads to upregulation of GL7 and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality
GW7|GL7|SLG7	cell elongation	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	 GL7 encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana LONGIFOLIA proteins, which regulate longitudinal cell elongation
GW7|GL7|SLG7	breeding	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	 Sequence analysis indicates that allelic variants of GL7 and its negative regulator are associated with grain size diversity and that the CNV at the GL7 locus was selected for and used in breeding
GW7|GL7|SLG7	breeding	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	 Our work suggests that pyramiding beneficial alleles of GL7 and other yield- and quality-related genes may improve the breeding of elite rice varieties
GW7|GL7|SLG7	quality	Copy number variation at the GL7 locus contributes to grain size diversity in rice.	1-kb segment at the GL7 locus leads to upregulation of GL7 and downregulation of its nearby negative regulator, resulting in an increase in grain length and improvement of grain appearance quality
