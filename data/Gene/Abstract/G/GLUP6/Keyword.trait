GLUP6	seed	A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm	 Overall, our results indicate that GLUP6/GEF is the activator of Rab5 GTPase and that the cycling of GTP- and GDP-bound forms of this regulatory protein is essential for the intracellular transport of proglutelin and alpha-globulin from the Golgi to PSVs and in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in rice seeds
GLUP6	endosperm	A guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 proteins is essential for intracellular transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole in rice endosperm	 Immunofluorescence studies showed that the transport of proglutelins and alpha-globulins to PSV was disrupted in glup6 endosperm| Secreted granules of glutelin and alpha-globulin were readily observed in young glup6 endosperm, followed by the formation of large dilated paramural bodies (PMBs) containing both proteins as the endosperm matures
