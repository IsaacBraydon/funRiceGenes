BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	G1	A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.	We then examined the effect of th1 mutation on the lemma-like structure formed in the long sterile lemma/glume1 (g1) and extra glume1 (eg1) mutants
BLS1|BSG1|OsG1L6|TH1|AFD1	G1	A role for TRIANGULAR HULL1 in fine-tuning spikelet morphogenesis in rice.	The result showed that the th1 mutation strongly affected the morphology of the extra lemma of eg1, but had no significant effect on the transformed lemma of g1
G1	OsCDC48	OsCDC48/48E complex is required for plant survival in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Removal of the C-terminus of OsCDC48 caused altered expression of cell cycle-related genes, changed the percentage of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, and abolished the interaction between OsCDC48 itself and between OsCDC48 and OsCDC48E, respectively

G1	pds1	The rice pds1 locus genetically interacts with partner to cause panicle exsertion defects and ectopic tillers in spikelets.	 qPCR analysis revealed that Loc_Os080595 might be the target of pds1 locus, and G1 gene might be involved in the genetic mechanism underlying the pds phenotype
