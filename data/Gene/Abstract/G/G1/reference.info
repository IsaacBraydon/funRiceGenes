PNAS-2009-Yoshida-20103-8.pdf	The homeotic gene long sterile lemma (G1) specifies sterile lemma identity in the rice spikelet	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8654, Japan.	The mechanism of floral organ specification is principally conserved in angiosperms, as demonstrated by the ABC model. By contrast, mechanisms that regulate the development of organs or structures specific to a group of species remain unclear. Grasses have unique inflorescence units, comprising spikelets and florets. In the genus Oryza (rice), the single spikelet consists of a fertile floret subtended by a lemma and a palea, two sterile lemmas, and rudimentary glumes. Each sterile lemma is a tiny glume-like organ with a smooth surface. Here, we have examined a long sterile lemma1 (g1) mutant, in which the sterile lemma is enlarged like the lemma. Detailed phenotypic analysis reveals that the large sterile lemma in the g1 mutant appears to be caused by homeotic transformation of the sterile lemma into a lemma, suggesting that G1 is involved in the repression of lemma identity to specify the sterile lemma. Gene isolation reveals that G1 is a member of a plant-specific gene family that encodes proteins with a previously uncharacterized domain, named here ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1). G1 mRNA is expressed in sterile lemma primordia throughout their development, and G1 protein is localized in the nucleus. A trans-activation assay using the yeast GAL4 system suggests that G1 is involved in transcriptional regulation. Repression of lemma identity by G1 is consistent with a hypothesis proposed to explain the morphological evolution of rice spikelets. We also show that a wild rice species, Oryza grandiglumis, that forms large sterile lemmas has serious mutations in the G1 gene.
NA	G1/ELE Functions in the Development of Rice Lemmas in Addition to Determining Identities of Empty Glumes.	2016	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas, College of Agronomy, Northwest A&amp;F University, Yangling China.	Rice empty glumes, also named sterile lemmas or rudimentary lemmas according to different interpretations, are distinct from lemmas in morphology and cellular pattern. Consistently, the molecular mechanism to control the development of lemmas is different from that of empty glumes. Rice LEAFY HULL STERILE1(OsLHS1) and DROOPING LEAF(DL) regulate the cellular pattern and the number of vascular bundles of lemmas respectively, while LONG STERILE LEMMA1 (G1)/ELONGATED EMPTY GLUME (ELE) and PANICLE PHYTOMER2 (PAP2)/OsMADS34 determine identities of empty glumes. Though some progress has been made, identities of empty glumes remain unclear, and genetic interactions between lemma genes and glume genes have been rarely elucidated. In this research, a new G1/ELE mutant g1-6 was identified and the phenotype was analyzed. Similar to previously reported mutant lines of G1/ELE, empty glumes of g1-6 plants transform into lemma-like organs. Furthermore, Phenotypes of single and double mutant plants suggest that, in addition to their previously described gene-specific functions, G1/ELE and OsLHS1 play redundant roles in controlling vascular bundle number, cell volume, and cell layer number of empty glumes and lemmas. Meanwhile, expression patterns of G1/ELE in osmads1-z flowers and OsLHS1 in g1-6 flowers indicate they do not regulate each other at the level of transcription. Finally, down-regulation of the empty glume gene OsMADS34/PAP2 and ectopic expression of the lemma gene DL, in the g1-6 plants provide further evidence that empty glumes are sterile lemmas. Generally, our findings provided valuable information for better understanding functions of G1 and OsLHS1 in flower development and identities of empty glumes.
