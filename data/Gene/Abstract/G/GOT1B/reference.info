NA	The Dual Roles of the Golgi Transport 1 (GOT1B): RNA Localization to the Cortical Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Export of Proglutelin and α-Globulin from the Cortical-ER to the Golgi.	2016	Plant Cell Physiol	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan (M.F., T.M., T.K.);	The rice glup2 lines are characterized by their abnormally high levels of endosperm 57 kDa proglutelins and of the luminal chaperone BiP, features characteristic of a defect within the endoplasmic reticulum. To elucidate the underlying genetic basis, the glup2 locus was identified by map based cloning. DNA sequencing of the genomes of three glup2 alleles and wild type demonstrated that the underlying genetic basis was mutations in Golgi transport 1 (GOT1B) coding sequence. This conclusion was further validated by restoration of normal proglutelin levels in a glup2 line complemented by a GOT1B gene. Microscopic analyses indicated the presence of proglutelin - α-globulin containing intracisternal granules surrounded by prolamine inclusions within the ER lumen. As assessed by in situ RT-PCR analysis of developing endosperm sections, prolamine and α-globulin RNAs were found to be mis-targeted from their usual sites on the protein body-ER to the cisternal-ER, the normal sites of proglutelin synthesis. Our results indicate that GLUP2/GOT1B has a dual role during rice endosperm development. It is required for localization of prolamine and α-globulin RNAs to the protein body-ER and for efficient export of proglutelin and α-globulin proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus.
NA	GOLGI TRANSPORT 1B Regulates Protein Export from Endoplasmic Reticulum in Rice Endosperm Cells.	2016	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University CITY: Nanjing China [CN].	Coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates the first step of anterograde transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to other endomembrane compartments in eukaryotes. A group of evolutionarily conserved proteins (Sar1, Sec23, Sec24, Sec13 and Sec31) constitutes the basic COPII coat machinery; however, the details of how the COPII coat assembly is regulated remain unclear. Here, we report a protein transport mutant of rice (Oryza sativa), named glutelin precursor accumulation4 (gpa4), which accumulates 57-kDa glutelin precursors, and forms two types of ER-derived abnormal structures. GPA4 encodes an evolutionarily conserved membrane protein GOT1B (also known as Glup2), homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GOT1p. The rice GOT1B protein co-localizes with Arabidopsis thaliana Sar1b at Golgi-associated ER exit sites (ERESs) when they are co-expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Moreover, GOT1B physically interacts with rice Sec23 and both proteins are present in the same complex(es) with rice Sar1b. The distribution of rice Sar1 in the endomembrane system, its association with rice Sec23c and the ERES organization pattern are significantly altered in the gpa4 mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that GOT1B plays an important role in mediating COPII vesicle formation at ERESs, thus facilitating anterograde transport of secretory proteins in plant cells.
