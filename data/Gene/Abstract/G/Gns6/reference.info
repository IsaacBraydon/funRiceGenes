As members of the pathogenesis-related protein (PR)-2 family, ¦Â-1,3-glucanases play pivotal roles in plant defense. Previous study showed that the rice genome contains 16 genes encoding putative ¦Â-1,3-glucanases, and the ¦Â-1,3-glucanases in subfamily A were deduced to be involved in plant defense. However, there was limited direct evidence. In this study, the expression of rice ¦Â-1,3-glucanases Gns2-Gns6 belonging to subfamily A in rice plant infection with Magnaporthe oryzae was investigated, and the enhanced expression of Gns6 during infection confirmed its crucial role in the defense of rice seedlings. Enzymological characterization revealed that Gns6 preferentially hydrolyzed laminarin, pachymaran, and yeast glucan. The ¦Â-1,3; 1,6-glucanase Gns6 exhibited a specific activity of 1.2 U/mg with laminarin as the substrate. In addition, Gns6 could hydrolyze laminarin via an endo-type mechanism, yielding a series of oligosaccharides with various degrees of polymerization that are known immune elicitors in plants. Moreover, Gns6 exhibited a significant inhibitory effect against the formation of the germ tubes and appressoria, with potential applications in plant protection. Taken together, this study shows that Gns6 is an essential effector in the defensive response of rice against pathogenic fungi.
