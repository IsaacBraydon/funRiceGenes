GluB-1	seed	The 3'-untranslated region of rice glutelin GluB-1 affects accumulation of heterologous protein in transgenic rice	 Accumulation of mDer f 2 in transgenic seed and leaf using the GluB-1 terminator was greater than when using the Nos terminator construct| The mDer f 2 mRNA containing the GluB-1 3'UTR was processed and polyadenylated at the same sites as the native GluB-1 mRNA in the seeds but diverged in leaves of the transgenic plants
GluB-1	panicle	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	 In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey
GluB-1	seed	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	 The promoter region of GluB-1, one of the glutelin genes in rice, has been intensively used as a model to understand regulation of seed-storage protein accumulation|Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice
GluB-1	leaf	The 3'-untranslated region of rice glutelin GluB-1 affects accumulation of heterologous protein in transgenic rice	 Accumulation of mDer f 2 in transgenic seed and leaf using the GluB-1 terminator was greater than when using the Nos terminator construct
GluB-1	endosperm	Identification of cis-regulatory elements required for endosperm expression of the rice storage protein glutelin gene GluB-1	 Therefore, we conclude that at least three cis-regulatory elements, the AACA motif, GCN4 motif and ACGT motif, are necessary to mediate endosperm expression of the GluB-1 glutelin gene|Identification of cis-regulatory elements required for endosperm expression of the rice storage protein glutelin gene GluB-1
GluB-1	grain	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	 In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey| We propose that OsGZF1 has a function in regulating the GluB-1 promoter and controls accumulation of glutelins during grain development
