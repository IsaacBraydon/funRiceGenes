GluB-1	OsGZF1	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey
GluB-1	OsGZF1	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	Transient expression experiments demonstrated that OsGZF1 can down-regulate a GluB-1-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter and OsGZF1 was also able to significantly reduce activation conferred by RISBZ1 which is a known strong GluB-1 activator
GluB-1	OsGZF1	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	We propose that OsGZF1 has a function in regulating the GluB-1 promoter and controls accumulation of glutelins during grain development
GluB-1	OsGZF1	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice	Functions of the CCCH type zinc finger protein OsGZF1 in regulation of the seed storage protein GluB-1 from rice
GluB-1	OsPht1;8|OsPT8	Phosphate transporter OsPht1;8 in rice plays an important role in phosphorus redistribution from source to sink organs and allocation between embryo and endosperm of seeds.	In this study, we knocked down expression of a phosphate transporter gene OsPht1;8 (OsPT8) selectively in shoot and/or in seed endosperm by RNA-interference using RISBZ1 and GluB-1 promoter (designate these transgenic lines as SSRi and EnSRi), respectively, to characterize the role of OsPT8 in P redistribution of rice
GluB-1	OsGLK1	Rice carotenoid biofortification and yield improvement conferred by endosperm-specific overexpression of OsGLK1.	 Transgenic overexpression of all four genes (OsGLK1, tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI) driven by rice endosperm-specific promoter GluB-1 established a mini carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in the endosperm and exerted a roughly multiplicative effect on the carotenoid accumulation as compared with the overexpression of only three genes (tHMG1, ZmPSY1, and PaCrtI)
