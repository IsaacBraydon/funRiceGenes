Rice storage protein glutelin genes are coordinately regulated during seed development. A previous 5' deletion analysis using transgenic tobacco revealed that the minimum 5' region necessary for endosperm specificity was within -245 bp of the transcription start site, and included the AACA and GCN4 motifs that are highly conserved in the 5'-flanking regions of all glutelin genes. In this paper, the sequence elements essential for endosperm-specific expression are characterized in stable transgenic tobacco plants by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using this minimum promoter. Base substitution analysis shows that the proximal AACA motif between -73 and -61, and the GCN4 motif between -165 and -158 act as critical elements. An ACGT motif between -81 and -75, and Skn-I-like elements between -173 and -169 also play important roles in controlling the seed-specific expression. When the distal region between -245 and -145 containing the AACA and the GCN4 motifs or the proximal region between -113 and -46 containing the ACGT and AACA motifs is fused to a truncated promoter (-90 to +9) of the CaMV 35S gene fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, high levels of seed-specific expression are observed in these fusions, thereby indicating that either pair of motifs is sufficient to confer seed expression in these fusions. However, when substituted for by the CaMV 35S core promoter (-46 to +1), seed expression is abolished, suggesting that the sequence between -90 and -46 of the CaMV 35S promoter containing G-box-like motif (as-1 element) is required for such specific expression in addition to AACA and GCN4 motifs. Therefore, we conclude that at least three cis-regulatory elements, the AACA motif, GCN4 motif and ACGT motif, are necessary to mediate endosperm expression of the GluB-1 glutelin gene.

We compared the effect of the rice storage protein glutelin B-1 (GluB-1) terminator with the nopaline synthase (Nos) terminator on the accumulation of the modified house dust mite allergen mDer f 2 driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter in transgenic rice. Accumulation of mDer f 2 in transgenic seed and leaf using the GluB-1 terminator was greater than when using the Nos terminator construct. The mDer f 2 mRNA containing the GluB-1 3'UTR was processed and polyadenylated at the same sites as the native GluB-1 mRNA in the seeds but diverged in leaves of the transgenic plants. In contrast, the poly(A) sites of mDer f 2 containing Nos 3'UTR were more divergent in both seed and leaf. These results suggest that GluB-1 3'UTR functions as a faithful terminator and that termination at the specific sites may play an important role in mRNA stability and/or translatability, resulting in higher levels of protein accumulation.

Glutelins are the most abundant storage proteins in rice grain and can make up to 80 % of total protein content. The promoter region of GluB-1, one of the glutelin genes in rice, has been intensively used as a model to understand regulation of seed-storage protein accumulation. In this study, we describe a zinc finger gene of the Cys3His1 (CCCH or C3H) class, named OsGZF1, which was identified in a yeast one-hybrid screening using the core promoter region of GluB-1 as bait and cDNA expression libraries prepared from developing rice panicles and grains as prey. The OsGZF1 protein binds specifically to the bait sequence in yeast and this interaction was confirmed in vitro. OsGZF1 is predominantly expressed in a confined domain surrounding the scutellum of the developing embryo and is localised in the nucleus. Transient expression experiments demonstrated that OsGZF1 can down-regulate a GluB-1-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter and OsGZF1 was also able to significantly reduce activation conferred by RISBZ1 which is a known strong GluB-1 activator. Furthermore, down-regulation of OsGZF1 by an RNAi approach increased grain nitrogen concentration. We propose that OsGZF1 has a function in regulating the GluB-1 promoter and controls accumulation of glutelins during grain development.
