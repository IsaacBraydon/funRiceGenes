J. Exp. Bot.-2003-Suzuki-1997-9.pdf	Cloning and expression of a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase gene in rice	2003	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Gakuen-cho 1-1, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan.	A cDNA fragment was cloned from rice immature seeds by the RT-PCR method. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA showed a high degree of identity with UDP-d-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) from other plants and was most similar to the soluble UXS from Arabidopsis. The recombinant protein, expressed in an Escherichia coli system, catalysed the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronic acid to UDP-d-xylose, confirming that the gene encoded UXS. The uxs gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the uxs gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period. This is the first report of the cloning of the uxs gene from monocots.
NA	OsDMI3-mediated OsUXS3 phosphorylation improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating OsCATB protein abundance in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Calcium (Ca(2+) )/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is an important positive regulator of antioxidant defenses and tolerance against oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) CCaMK (OsDMI3) physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsUXS3, a cytosol-localized UDP-xylose synthase. Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that OsUXS3 acts downstream of OsDMI3 to enhance the oxidative stress tolerance conferred by higher catalase (CAT) activity. Indeed, OsUXS3 interacted with CAT isozyme B (OsCATB), and this interaction was required to increase OsCATB protein abundance under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, we showed that OsDMI3 phosphorylates OsUXS3 on residue Ser-245, thereby further promoting the interaction between OsUXS3 and OsCATB. Our results indicate that OsDMI3 promotes the association of OsUXS3 with OsCATB to enhance CAT activity under oxidative stress. These findings reveal OsUXS3 as a direct target of OsDMI3 and demonstrate its involvement in antioxidant defense.
NA	The UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase OsUXS3 regulates Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress by interacting with OsCATs in rice.	2023	Plant Physiol Biochem	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Overly Na(+) ion in soil caused by salt stress has a significant negative impact on the growth and production of crops, especially rice (Oryza sativa L.). Therefore, it is vital for us to clarify how salt stress tolerance in rice is caused by Na(+) ion toxicity. The UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of UDP-xylose, which is the key substrate of cytoderm synthesis in plants. In this study, we found that OsUXS3, a rice UXS, is a positive regulator to regulate Na(+) ion toxicity under salt stress by interacting with OsCATs (Oryza sativa catalase; OsCAT). The expression of OsUXS3 was significantly up-regulated under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments of rice seedlings. Meanwhile, by the genetic and biochemical evidence, knockout of OsUXS3 significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreased CAT activity under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments in tissue. Furthermore, knockout of OsUXS3 caused excessive accumulation of Na (+) ion and rapid loss of K(+) ion and disrupts Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis under NaCl and NaHCO(3) treatments. Based on the results above, we can conclude that OsUXS3 might regulate CAT activity by interacting with OsCATs, which is not only characterized for the first time but also regulating Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis, positively regulating the Na(+) ion toxicity tolerance under salt stress in rice.
