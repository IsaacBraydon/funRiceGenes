J. Exp. Bot.-2003-Suzuki-1997-9.pdf	Cloning and expression of a UDP-glucuronic acid decarboxylase gene in rice	2003	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Gakuen-cho 1-1, Sakai, Osaka 599-8531, Japan.	A cDNA fragment was cloned from rice immature seeds by the RT-PCR method. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA showed a high degree of identity with UDP-d-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) from other plants and was most similar to the soluble UXS from Arabidopsis. The recombinant protein, expressed in an Escherichia coli system, catalysed the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronic acid to UDP-d-xylose, confirming that the gene encoded UXS. The uxs gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the uxs gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period. This is the first report of the cloning of the uxs gene from monocots.
NA	OsDMI3-mediated OsUXS3 phosphorylation improves oxidative stress tolerance by modulating OsCATB protein abundance in rice.	2022	J Integr Plant Biol	College of Life Sciences, National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Key Laboratory of Crop Physiology Ecology and Production Management, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Calcium (Ca(2+) )/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) is an important positive regulator of antioxidant defenses and tolerance against oxidative stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we report that the rice (Oryza sativa) CCaMK (OsDMI3) physically interacts with and phosphorylates OsUXS3, a cytosol-localized UDP-xylose synthase. Genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that OsUXS3 acts downstream of OsDMI3 to enhance the oxidative stress tolerance conferred by higher catalase (CAT) activity. Indeed, OsUXS3 interacted with CAT isozyme B (OsCATB), and this interaction was required to increase OsCATB protein abundance under oxidative stress conditions. Furthermore, we showed that OsDMI3 phosphorylates OsUXS3 on residue Ser-245, thereby further promoting the interaction between OsUXS3 and OsCATB. Our results indicate that OsDMI3 promotes the association of OsUXS3 with OsCATB to enhance CAT activity under oxidative stress. These findings reveal OsUXS3 as a direct target of OsDMI3 and demonstrate its involvement in antioxidant defense.
