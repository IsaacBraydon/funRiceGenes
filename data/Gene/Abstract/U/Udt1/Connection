TDR	Udt1	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development	 These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1)
TDR	Udt1	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development	 While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development
OsMYBGA|OsGAMYB	Udt1	Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development	 These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1)

OsHUB1|MIP1	Udt1	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice	Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 were down-regulated in the mutants.

OsABCG26	Udt1	An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice	 Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport
