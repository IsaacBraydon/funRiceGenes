UTR319	seed	Isolation of a novel UVB-tolerant rice mutant obtained by exposure to carbon-ion beams	Here, an ultraviolet-B (UVB)-tolerant rice mutant, utr319 (UV Tolerant Rice 319), was isolated from a mutagenized population derived from 2500 M1 seeds (of the UVB-resistant cultivar 'Sasanishiki') that were exposed to carbon ions
