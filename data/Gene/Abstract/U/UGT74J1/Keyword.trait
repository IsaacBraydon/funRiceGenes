UGT74J1	homeostasis	A Ubiquitously Expressed UDP-Glucosyltransferase, UGT74J1, Controls Basal Salicylic Acid Levels in Rice.	 Mutants of UGT74J1 generated by genome editing accumulated high levels of SA under non-stressed conditions, indicating that UGT74J1 is a key enzyme for SA homeostasis in rice
