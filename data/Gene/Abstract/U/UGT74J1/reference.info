NA	A Ubiquitously Expressed UDP-Glucosyltransferase, UGT74J1, Controls Basal Salicylic Acid Levels in Rice.	2021	Plants (Basel)	Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO), Kannondai, Tsukuba 305-8604, Japan.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a phytohormone that regulates a variety of physiological and developmental processes, including disease resistance. SA is a key signaling component in the immune response of many plant species. However, the mechanism underlying SA-mediated immunity is obscure in rice (Oryza sativa). Prior analysis revealed a correlation between basal SA level and blast resistance in a range of rice varieties. This suggested that resistance might be improved by increasing basal SA level. Here, we identified a novel UDP-glucosyltransferase gene, UGT74J1, which is expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development. Mutants of UGT74J1 generated by genome editing accumulated high levels of SA under non-stressed conditions, indicating that UGT74J1 is a key enzyme for SA homeostasis in rice. Microarray analysis revealed that the ugt74j1 mutants constitutively overexpressed a set of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. An inoculation assay demonstrated that these mutants had increased resistance against rice blast, but they also exhibited stunted growth phenotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rice mutant displaying SA overaccumulation.
