UGT2	 The transcription factor OsbZIP23 was demonstrated to regulate the UGT2 expression under stress conditions |  When the soil-grown UGT2 transgenic plants were subjected to salt stress, we also found that ugt2ko mutant lines were severely withered and most of them died, while the overexpression lines grew well and had higher survival rate |  Compared with wild-type plants, UGT2 overexpression greatly increased the expression levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenging genes and stress-responsive genes	 When the soil-grown UGT2 transgenic plants were subjected to salt stress, we also found that ugt2ko mutant lines were severely withered and most of them died, while the overexpression lines grew well and had higher survival rate |  Compared with wild-type plants, UGT2 overexpression greatly increased the expression levels of the reactive oxygen species scavenging genes and stress-responsive genes
