OsbZIP23	UGT2	Rice glycosyltransferase gene UGT2 functions in salt stress tolerance under the regulation of bZIP23 transcription factor.	 The transcription factor OsbZIP23 was demonstrated to regulate the UGT2 expression under stress conditions
OsbZIP23	UGT2	Rice glycosyltransferase gene UGT2 functions in salt stress tolerance under the regulation of bZIP23 transcription factor.	 Furthermore, the upstream regulatory mechanism of the UGT2 gene was identified and we found that a bZIP transcription factor, OsbZIP23, can bind to the UGT2 promoter and enhance the UGT2 transcription levels
