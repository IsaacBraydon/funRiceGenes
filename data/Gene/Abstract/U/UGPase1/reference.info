Two homologous UGPase genes, OsUgp1 and OsUgp2, exist in rice genome. OsUgp1 has recently been reported to be essential for callose deposition during pollen mother cell and meiosis stages as well as for seed carbohydrate metabolism. In this study, a full-length cDNA of OsUgp2 was isolated from rice anther. Northern blot and RNA in situ hybridization indicated that the expression of OsUgp2 was preferentially in pollen and developmentally regulated. No transcripts were found in leaf, stem, lemma/palea, ripening grain and florets before the uninucleate microspore developmental stage, but a large quantity of OsUgp2 mRNA was found in pollen at the binucleate and mature stages. The immunolocalization of OsUgp2 showed a similar expression pattern to that by RNA in situ hybridization. The function of OsUgp2 was investigated by dsRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing. The pollen fertility of 16 independent transgenic rice plants was found between 25% and 90%, which was correlated with the amount of OsUgp2 mRNA. The results of morphological changes and starch variation during pollen development in transgenic rice showed that the abnormal feature of pollen development appeared after the uninucleate microspore stage. Starch failed to accumulate in pollen and thus led to sterile pollens. These results demonstrated that OsUgp2 is a pollen-preferential â€œlate geneâ€<U+393C><U+3E64> and plays a key role during pollen maturation, especially for starch accumulation. OsUgp2 complements OsUgp1 to fulfill the UGPaseâ€™s functions necessary for the full process of pollen development.

The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains two homologous UGPase genes, Ugp1 and Ugp2. We report a functional characterization of rice Ugp1, which is expressed throughout the plant, with highest expression in florets, especially in pollen during anther development. Ugp1 silencing by RNA interference or cosuppression results in male sterility. Expressing a double-stranded RNA interference construct in Ugp1-RI plants resulted in complete suppression of both Ugp1 and Ugp2, together with various pleiotropic developmental abnormalities, suggesting that UGPase plays critical roles in plant growth and development. More importantly, Ugp1-cosuppressing plants contained unprocessed intron-containing primary transcripts derived from transcription of the overexpression construct. These aberrant transcripts undergo temperature-sensitive splicing in florets, leading to a novel thermosensitive genic male sterility. Pollen mother cells (PMCs) of Ugp1-silenced plants appeared normal before meiosis, but during meiosis, normal callose deposition was disrupted. Consequently, the PMCs began to degenerate at the early meiosis stage, eventually resulting in complete pollen collapse. In addition, the degeneration of the tapetum and middle layer was inhibited. These results demonstrate that rice Ugp1 is required for callose deposition during PMC meiosis and bridges the apoplastic unloading pathway and pollen development.

A rice genic male-sterility gene ms-h is recessive and has a pleiotropic effect on the chalky endosperm. After fine mapping, nucleotide sequencing analysis of the ms-h gene revealed a single nucleotide substitution at the 3'-splice junction of the 14th intron of the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 1 (UGPase1; EC2.7.7.9) gene, which causes the expression of two mature transcripts with abnormal sizes caused by the aberrant splicing. An in vitro functional assay showed that both proteins encoded by the two abnormal transcripts have no UGPase activity. The suppression of UGPase by the introduction of a UGPase1-RNAi construct in wild-type plants nearly eliminated seed set because of the male defect, with developmental retardation similar to the ms-h mutant phenotype, whereas overexpression of UGPase1 in ms-h mutant plants restored male fertility and the transformants produced T(1) seeds that segregated into normal and chalky endosperms. In addition, both phenotypes were co-segregated with the UGPase1 transgene in segregating T(1) plants, which demonstrates that UGPase1 has functional roles in both male sterility and the development of a chalky endosperm. Our results suggest that UGPase1 plays a key role in pollen development as well as seed carbohydrate metabolism.

One cDNA clone, possessing about 1,700 nucleotides, contained the complete open reading frame of rice UGPase. At the nucleotide-sequence level, the UGPase cDNA of rice endosperm had high homology with the UGPase cDNA of barley endosperm (84%) and potato tuber (71%). The calculated molecular weight (50 kDa) agrees with the value determined by SDS-PAGE (51 kDa). At the amino-acid sequence level, rice UGPase has high homology with the UGPase of barley (92%) and potato (85%). The enzyme contained conserved sequence elements which are thought to be involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. A Southern-blot analysis indicated that the gene existed as a single copy. Expression of the enzyme in rice endosperm examined by Northern-blot analysis was high at 10-15 days after heading.
