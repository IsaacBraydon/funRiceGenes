UGT85E1	 The overexpression of UGT85E1 led to an enhanced tolerance in transgenic rice plants to drought stress, while the ugt85e1 mutants of rice showed a more sensitive phenotype to drought stress |  Further studies indicated that UGT85E1 overexpression induced ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, increased proline and sugar contents, and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress conditions	 The overexpression of UGT85E1 led to an enhanced tolerance in transgenic rice plants to drought stress, while the ugt85e1 mutants of rice showed a more sensitive phenotype to drought stress |  Further studies indicated that UGT85E1 overexpression induced ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, increased proline and sugar contents, and upregulated expression of stress-related genes under drought stress conditions
