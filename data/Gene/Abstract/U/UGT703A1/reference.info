NA	Identification of functionally important microRNAs from rice inflorescence at heading stage of a qDTY4.1-QTL bearing Near Isogenic Line under drought conditions.	2017	PLoS One	School of Biotechnology and Bioscience, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.	A cross between IR64 (high-yielding but drought-susceptible) and Aday Sel (drought-tolerant) rice cultivars yielded a stable line with enhanced grain yield under drought screening field trials at International Rice Research Institute. The major effect qDTY4.1 drought tolerance and yield QTL was detected in the IR77298-14-1-2-10 Backcrossed Inbred Line (BIL) and its IR87705-7-15-B Near Isogenic Line (NIL) with 93.9% genetic similarity to IR64. Although rice yield is extremely susceptible to water stress at reproductive stage, currently, there is only one report on the detection of drought-responsive microRNAs in inflorescence tissue of a Japonica rice line. In this study, more drought-responsive microRNAs were identified in the inflorescence tissues of IR64, IR77298-14-1-2-10 and IR87705-7-15-B via next-generation sequencing. Among the 32 families of inflorescence-specific non-conserved microRNAs that were identified, 22 families were up-regulated in IR87705-7-15-B. Overall 9 conserved and 34 non-conserved microRNA families were found as drought-responsive in rice inflorescence with 5 conserved and 30 non-conserved families induced in the IR87705-7-15-B. The observation of more drought-responsive non-conserved microRNAs may imply their prominence over conserved microRNAs in drought response mechanisms of rice inflorescence. Gene Ontology annotation analysis on the target genes of drought-responsive microRNAs identified in IR87705-7-15-B revealed over-representation of biological processes including development, signalling and response to stimulus. Particularly, four inflorescence-specific microRNAs viz. osa-miR5485, osa-miR5487, osa-miR5492 and osa-miR5517, and two non-inflorescence specific microRNAs viz. osa-miR169d and osa-miR169f.2 target genes that are involved in flower or embryonic development. Among them, osa-miR169d, osa-miR5492 and osa-miR5517 are related to flowering time control. It is also worth mentioning that osa-miR2118 and osa-miR2275, which are implicated in the biosynthesis of rice inflorescence-specific small interfering RNAs, were induced in IR87705-7-15-B but repressed in IR77298-14-1-2-10. Further, gene search within qDTY4.1 QTL region had identified multiple copies of NBS-LRR resistance genes (potential target of osa-miR2118), subtilisins and genes implicated in stomatal movement, ABA metabolism and cuticular wax biosynthesis.
NA	Substrate specificity and safener inducibility of the plant UDP-glucose-dependent family 1 glycosyltransferase super-family.	2017	Plant Biotechnol J	School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.	Plants contain large numbers of family 1 UDP-glucose-dependent glycosyltransferases (UGTs), including members that conjugate xenobiotics. Arabidopsis contains 107 UGT genes with 99 family members successfully expressed as glutathione transferase (GST)-fusion proteins in E.Â coli. A high-throughput catalytic screen was developed based on quantification of the fusion by measuring GST activity. UGT activity using UDP-glucose as donor was then determined using 11 synthetic acceptors bearing hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups that had been shown to undergo conjugation in plant extracts. In total, 44 UGTs, largely members of the D and E groups, were active towards xenobiotics, glucosylating phenol and thiol acceptors. In contrast, N-glucosyltransferase (NGT) activity was almost exclusively restricted to a single enzyme, UGT72B1. Using DNA microarrays, the induction of UGT transcripts following treatment with the herbicide safener fenclorim was compared in Arabidopsis and rice. D and L group members were the most safener-inducible UGTs in both species. The respective Arabidopsis enzymes showed low conjugating activity towards xenobiotics. Using Genevestigator, a small group of safened D and L UGTs were consistently induced in response to biotic and abiotic stress suggestive of protective activities beyond xenobiotic detoxification in both species. The induction of other detoxifying gene families following treatment with fenclorim, namely cytochromes P450 and glutathione transferases, further confirmed the selective enhancement of related subfamily members in the two species giving new insight into the safening response in cereals, where herbicide tolerance is enhanced compared with dicots, which are unresponsive to these treatments.
