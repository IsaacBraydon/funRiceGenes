Nrat1	transporter	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice
Nrat1	transporter	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles
Nrat1	root	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells
Nrat1	root	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
Nrat1	manganese	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex
Nrat1	transcription factor	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1)
Nrat1	iron	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex
Nrat1	aluminum	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice
Nrat1	cell wall	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals
Nrat1	cadmium	Plasma membrane-localized transporter for aluminum in rice	When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex
Nrat1	tolerance	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.
Nrat1	tolerance	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.	 Haplotype analysis of Nrat1 using 327 3K RGP accessions indicated that minor allele variations in aus and indica subpopulations decreased Al toxicity tolerance in rice
Nrat1	aluminum	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.
