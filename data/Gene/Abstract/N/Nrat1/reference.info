Aluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, but its trivalent ionic form is highly toxic to all organisms at low concentrations. How Al enters cells has not been elucidated in any organisms. Herein, we report a transporter, Nrat1 (Nramp aluminum transporter 1), specific for trivalent Al ion in rice. Nrat1 belongs to the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family, but shares a low similarity with other Nramp members. When expressed in yeast, Nrat1 transports trivalent Al ion, but not other divalent ions, such as manganese, iron, and cadmium, or the Al-citrate complex. Nrat1 is localized at the plasma membranes of all cells of root tips except epidermal cells. Knockout of Nrat1 resulted in decreased Al uptake, increased Al binding to cell wall, and enhanced Al sensitivity, but did not affect the tolerance to other metals. Expression of Nrat1 is up-regulated by Al in the roots and regulated by a C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (ART1). We therefore concluded that Nrat1 is a plasma membrane-localized transporter for trivalent Al, which is required for a prior step of final Al detoxification through sequestration of Al into vacuoles.
NA	Hydrogen Sulfide Alleviates Aluminum Toxicity via Decreasing Apoplast and Symplast Al Contents in Rice.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, China.	Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a vital role in Al3+stress resistance in plants, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present study, pretreatment with 2 ¦ÌM of the H2S donor NaHS significantly alleviated the inhibition of root elongation caused by Al toxicity in rice roots, which was accompanied by a decrease in Al contents in root tips under 50 ¦ÌM Al3+treatment. NaHS pretreatment decreased the negative charge in cell walls by reducing the activity of pectin methylesterase and decreasing the pectin and hemicellulose contents in rice roots. This treatment also masked Al-binding sites in the cell wall by upregulating the expression ofOsSATR1andOsSTAR2in roots and reduced Al binding in the cell wall by stimulating the expression of the citrate acid exudation geneOsFRDL4and increasing the secretion of citrate acid. In addition, NaHS pretreatment decreased the symplasmic Al content by downregulating the expression ofOsNRAT1, and increasing the translocation of cytoplasmic Al to the vacuole via upregulating the expression ofOsALS1. The increment of antioxidant enzyme [superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD)] activity with NaHS pretreatment significantly decreased the MDA and H2O2content in rice roots, thereby reducing the damage of Al3+toxicity on membrane integrity in rice. H2S exhibits crosstalk with nitric oxide (NO) in response to Al toxicity, and through reducing NO content in root tips to alleviate Al toxicity. Together, this study establishes that H2S alleviates Al toxicity by decreasing the Al content in the apoplast and symplast of rice roots.
NA	Genome-wide association mapping of aluminum toxicity tolerance and fine mapping of a candidate gene for Nrat1 in rice.	2018	PLoS One	Institute of Crop Sciences/National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Aluminum (Al) stress is becoming the major limiting factor in crop production in acidic soils. Rice has been reported as the most Al-tolerant crop and the capacity of Al toxicity tolerance is generally evaluated by comparing root growth under Al stress. Here, we performed an association mapping of Al toxicity tolerance using a core collection of 211 indica rice accessions with 700 K high quality SNP data. A total of 21 putative QTL affecting shoot height (SH), root length (RL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root dry weight (RDW) and shoot water content (SWC) were identified at seedling stage, including three QTL detected only under control condition, eight detected only under Al stress condition, ten simultaneously detected in both control and Al stress conditions, and seven were identified by stress tolerance index of their corresponding traits. Total of 21 candidate genes for 7 important QTL regions associated with Al toxicity tolerance were identified based on combined haplotype analysis and functional annotation, and the most likely candidate gene(s) for each important QTL were also discussed. Also a candidate gene Nrat1 on chromosome 2 was further fine-mapped using BSA-seq and linkage analysis in the F2 population derived from the cross of Al tolerant accession CC105 and super susceptible accession CC180. A new non-synonymous SNP variation was observed at Nrat1 between CC105 and CC180, which resulted in an amino-acid substitution from Ala (A) in CC105 to Asp (D) in CC180. Haplotype analysis of Nrat1 using 327 3K RGP accessions indicated that minor allele variations in aus and indica subpopulations decreased Al toxicity tolerance in rice. The candidate genes identified in this study provide valuable information for improvement of Al toxicity tolerance in rice. Our research indicated that minor alleles are important for QTL mapping and its application in rice breeding when natural gene resources are used.
