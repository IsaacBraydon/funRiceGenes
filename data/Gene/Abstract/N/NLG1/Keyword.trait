NLG1	leaf	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
NLG1	development	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
NLG1	grain	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
NLG1	grain size	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
NLG1	mitochondria	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 Moreover, nlg1 also presents abnormal mitochondria structure and was sensitive to the inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain
NLG1	map-based cloning	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 Map-based cloning and transgenic functional confirmation revealed that NLG1 encodes a mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase containing a subunit Tim21
NLG1	homeostasis	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis
