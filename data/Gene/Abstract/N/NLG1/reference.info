NA	NLG1, encoding a mitochondrial membrane protein, controls leaf and grain development in rice.	2023	BMC Plant Biol	Rice Research Institute of Shenyang Agricultural University/Key Laboratory of Northern Japonica Rice Genetics and Breeding, Ministry of Education and Liaoning Province, Shenyang, 110866, China.	BACKGROUND: Mitochondrion is the key respiratory organ and participate in multiple anabolism and catabolism pathways in eukaryote. However, the underlying mechanism of how mitochondrial membrane proteins regulate leaf and grain development remains to be further elucidated. RESULTS: Here, a mitochondria-defective mutant narrow leaf and slender grain 1 (nlg1) was identified from an EMS-treated mutant population, which exhibits narrow leaves and slender grains. Moreover, nlg1 also presents abnormal mitochondria structure and was sensitive to the inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain. Map-based cloning and transgenic functional confirmation revealed that NLG1 encodes a mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase containing a subunit Tim21. GUS staining assay and RT-qPCR suggested that NLG1 was mainly expressed in leaves and panicles. The expression level of respiratory function and auxin response related genes were significantly down-regulated in nlg1, which may be responsible for the declination of ATP production and auxin content. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that NLG1 plays an important role in the regulation of leaf and grain size development by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Our finding provides a novel insight into the effects of mitochondria development on leaf and grain morphogenesis in rice.
