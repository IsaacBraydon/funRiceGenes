nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	cytosol	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	Similar to OsRIP1, nuRIP also locates in the cytosol and the nucleus.
nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	nucleus	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	Similar to OsRIP1, nuRIP also locates in the cytosol and the nucleus.
nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	root	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	Although the overall mass of the plants from nuRIP line 2 was similar to that of wild-type plants, they had significantly longer root and shoot compared to wild-type plants.
nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	shoot	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	Although the overall mass of the plants from nuRIP line 2 was similar to that of wild-type plants, they had significantly longer root and shoot compared to wild-type plants.
nuRIP|OsjRIP11.2	drought	Effect of RIP Overexpression on Abiotic Stress Tolerance and Development of Rice	The expression of OsRIP1 changes when rice is subjected to osmotic stress, ABA, jasmonates, cadmium, cold, drought and flooding, while the expression of nuRIP changes only during cadmium stress, drought, flooding and osmotic stress
