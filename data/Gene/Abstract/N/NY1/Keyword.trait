NY1|OsMAIL1	fertility	Cytological Observations and Bulked-Segregant Analysis Coupled Global Genome Sequencing Reveal Two Genes Associated with Pollen Fertility in Tetraploid Rice	 Two mutants ny1 (LOC_Os07g32406) and ny2 (LOC_Os07g32040) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in neo-tetraploid rice, and which exhibited low pollen fertility and abnormal chromosome behavior

NY1|OsMAIL1	development	An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.	An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.
NY1|OsMAIL1	development	An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.	 RESULTS: Here, cytological observations of the NY1 mutant (ny1) indicated that ny1 exhibited abnormal tapetum and middle layer development
NY1|OsMAIL1	pollen	An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.	 The mutant of EAT1 was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 that showed abnormal tapetum and pollen wall formation, which was similar to ny1
