Neo-tetraploid rice with high fertility is a useful germplasm for polyploid rice breeding, which was developed from the crossing of different autotetraploid rice lines. However, little information is available on the molecular mechanism underlying the fertility of neo-tetraploid rice. Here, two contrasting populations of tetraploid rice, including one with high fertility (hereafter referred to as JG) and another with low fertility (hereafter referred to as JD), were generated by crossing Huaduo 3 (H3), a high fertility neo-tetraploid rice that was developed by crossing Jackson-4x with 96025-4x, and Huajingxian74-4x (T452), a low fertility autotetraploid rice parent. Cytological, global genome sequencing-based bulked-segregant (BSA-seq) and CRISPR/Cas9 technology were employed to study the genes associated with pollen fertility in neo-tetraploid rice. The embryo sacs of JG and JD lines were normal; however, pollen fertility was low in JD, which led to scarce fertilization and low seed setting. Cytological observations displayed low pollen fertility (25.1%) and approximately 31.3 and 27.2% chromosome lagging at metaphase I and II, and 28.8 and 24.8% chromosome straggling at anaphase I and II in JD, respectively. BSA-seq of F2-3 generations and RNA-seq of F4 generation detected a common fragment, i.e., 18,915,234-19,500,000, at chromosome 7, which was comprised of 78 genes associated with fertility. Among 78 genes, 9 genes had been known to be involved in meiosis and pollen development. Two mutants ny1 (LOC_Os07g32406) and ny2 (LOC_Os07g32040) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout in neo-tetraploid rice, and which exhibited low pollen fertility and abnormal chromosome behavior. Our study revealed that two unknown genes, LOC_Os07g32406 (NY1) and LOC_Os07g32040 (NY2) play an important role in pollen development of neo-tetraploid rice and provides a new perspective about the genetic mechanisms of fertility in polyploid rice.
NA	An uncharacterized protein NY1 targets EAT1 to regulate anther tapetum development in polyploid rice.	2022	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	BACKGROUND: Autotetraploid rice is a useful germplasm for the breeding of polyploid rice; however, low fertility is a major hindrance for its utilization. Neo-tetraploid rice with high fertility was developed from the crossing of different autotetraploid rice lines. Our previous research showed that the mutant (ny1) of LOC_Os07g32406 (NY1), which was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out in neo-tetraploid rice, showed low pollen fertility, low seed set, and defective chromosome behavior during meiosis. However, the molecular genetic mechanism underlying the fertility remains largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, cytological observations of the NY1 mutant (ny1) indicated that ny1 exhibited abnormal tapetum and middle layer development. RNA-seq analysis displayed a total of 5606 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ny1 compared to wild type (H1) during meiosis, of which 2977 were up-regulated and 2629 were down-regulated. Among the down-regulated genes, 16 important genes associated with tapetal development were detected, including EAT1, CYP703A3, CYP704B2, DPW, PTC1, OsABCG26, OsAGO2, SAW1, OsPKS1, OsPKS2, and OsTKPR1. The mutant of EAT1 was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 that showed abnormal tapetum and pollen wall formation, which was similar to ny1. Moreover, 478 meiosis-related genes displayed down-regulation at same stage, including 9 important meiosis-related genes, such as OsREC8, OsSHOC1, SMC1, SMC6a and DCM1, and their expression levels were validated by qRT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results will aid in identifying the key genes associated with pollen fertility, which offered insights into the molecular mechanism underlying pollen development in tetraploid rice.
