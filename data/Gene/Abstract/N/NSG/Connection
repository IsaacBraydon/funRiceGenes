DL	NSG	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
