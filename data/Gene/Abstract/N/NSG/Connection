DL	NSG|NSG1	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
NSG|NSG1	OsMADS16|SPW1	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
NSG|NSG1	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes

DL	NSG|NSG1	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
NSG|NSG1	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 Furthermore, the NSG1 protein was able to bind to regulatory regions of LHS1, and then recruits the co-repressor TPRs to repress their expression by down-regulating histone acetylation levels of their chromatin
NSG|NSG1	OsLG3b|OsMADS1|LHS1|AFO	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
NSG|NSG1	OsMADS6|MFO1	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
