NSG	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
NSG|NSG1	 Furthermore, the NSG1 protein was able to bind to regulatory regions of LHS1, and then recruits the co-repressor TPRs to repress their expression by down-regulating histone acetylation levels of their chromatin |  The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
