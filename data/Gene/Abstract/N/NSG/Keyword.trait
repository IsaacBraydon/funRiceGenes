NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 nsg (nonstop glumes) mutant affecting spikelet development was identified from EMS-treated Jinhui10 (Oryza sativa L
NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The mutant phenotype suggests that NSG is involved in the whole rice spikelet development
NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes
