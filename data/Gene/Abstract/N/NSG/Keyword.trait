NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 nsg (nonstop glumes) mutant affecting spikelet development was identified from EMS-treated Jinhui10 (Oryza sativa L
NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The mutant phenotype suggests that NSG is involved in the whole rice spikelet development
NSG|NSG1	spikelet	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The expression of OsMADS4, OsMADS16, DL and OsMADS3 decreased distinctly, and OsMADS1 increased in nsg panicle, suggests that NSG affected spikelet development through influencing the expression of floral hometic genes

NSG|NSG1	floral	nonstop glumes (nsg), a novel mutant affects spikelet development in rice	 The mutation of NSG influenced the transcription level of some floral hometic genes

NSG|NSG1	spikelet	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 NSG1 encoded a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and was expressed mainly in the organ primordia of the spikelet
NSG|NSG1	spikelet	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 The results suggest that NSG1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining organ identities in the spikelet by repressing the expression of LHS1, DL, MFO1
NSG|NSG1	zinc	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 NSG1 encoded a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and was expressed mainly in the organ primordia of the spikelet
NSG|NSG1	R protein	NONSTOP GLUMES 1 Encoding a C2H2 Zinc Finger Protein That Regulates Spikelet Development in Rice.	 NSG1 encoded a member of the C2H2 zinc finger protein family and was expressed mainly in the organ primordia of the spikelet
