NAD3	R protein	Rice PPS1 encodes a DYW motif-containing pentatricopeptide repeat protein required for five consecutive RNA-editing sites of nad3 in mitochondria.	 Here, we show that a novel DYW motif-containing PPR protein, PPS1, is associated with five conserved RNA-editing sites of nad3 located in close proximity to each other in mitochondria, all of which involve conversion from proline to leucine in rice
