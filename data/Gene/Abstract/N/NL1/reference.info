In the monocot rice species Oryza sativa L., one of the most striking morphological processes during reproductive development is the concurrence of panicle development with the sequential elongation of upper internodes (UPIs). To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we cloned the rice gene NECK LEAF 1 (NL1), which when mutated results in delays in flowering time, smaller panicles with overgrown bracts and abnormal UPI elongation patterns. The NL1 gene encodes a GATA-type transcription factor with a single zinc finger domain, and its transcripts are detected predominantly in the bract primordia, which normally degenerate in the wild-type plants. Overexpression of NL1 in transgenic plants often gives rise to severe growth retardation, less vegetative phytomers and smaller leaves, suggesting that NL1 plays an important role in organ differentiation. A novel mutant allele of PLASTOCHRON1 (PLA1), a gene known to play a key role in regulating leaf initiation, was identified in this study. Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1. The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant. Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant. On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice.
NA	Short and narrow flag leaf1, a GATA zinc finger domain-containing protein, regulates flag leaf size in rice (Oryza sativa).	2018	BMC Plant Biol	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Rice Research Institute of Southwest University, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, China.	The flag leaf of rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important determinant of plant type characteristics and grain yield. Identification of flag leaf mutants of rice is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanism of flag-leaf development, and for exploitation of rice germplasm resources.In this study, we describe a mutant designated short and narrow flag leaf 1 (snfl1). Histological analysis showed that the length of epidermal cells and number of longitudinal veins were decreased in the flag leaf of the snfl1 mutant. Map-based cloning indicated that a member of the GATA family of transcription factors is a candidate gene for SNFL1. A single-nucleotide transition at the last base in the single intron of snfl1 led to variation in alternative splicing and early termination of translation. Complemented transgenic plants harbouring the candidate SNFL1 gene rescued the snfl1 mutant. Analysis of RT-PCR and the SNFL1 promoter by means of a GUS fusion expression assay showed that abundance of SNFL1 transcripts was higher in the culm, leaf sheath, and root. Expression of the SNFL1-GFP fusion protein in rice protoplasts showed that SNFL1 was localized in nucleus.We conclude that SNFL1 is an important regulator of leaf development, the identification of which might have important implications for future research on GATA transcription factors.
