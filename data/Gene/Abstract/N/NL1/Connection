NL1	PLA1	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	 Genetic analysis demonstrated an interaction between nl1 and pla1, with NL1 acting upstream of PLA1| The expression level and spatial pattern of PLA1 were found to be altered in the nl1 mutant| On the basis of these findings, we propose that NL1 is an intrinsic factor that modulates and coordinates organogenesis through regulating the expression of PLA1 and other regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice
Hd3a	NL1	NECK LEAF 1, a GATA type transcription factor, modulates organogenesis by regulating the expression of multiple regulatory genes during reproductive development in rice	 Furthermore, the expression of two regulators of flowering, Hd3a and OsMADS1, was also affected in the nl1 mutant
