Symbol	Keyword	Title	Evidence
NAL21	leaf	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Microscopic observation revealed defects in the vascular system and reduced epidermal cell size and number in the nal21 leaf blade
NAL21	leaf	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Transformation with modified OsARF11, OsARF16 and OsWOX3A genomic DNA lacking uORFs rescued the narrow leaf phenotype of nal21 to a better extent than transformation with their native genomic DNA, implying that RPS3A could regulate translation of ARFs and WOX3A through uORFs
NAL21	auxin	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 The nal21 mutant showed aberrant auxin responses in which multiple auxin response factors (ARFs) harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) were repressed at the translational level
NAL21	resistance	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Ribosome-targeting antibiotics resistance assay and ribosome profiling showed a significant reduction in the free 40S ribosome subunit in the nal21 mutant
NAL21	map-based cloning	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 Map-based cloning revealed that NAL21 encodes a ribosomal small subunit protein RPS3A
NAL21	auxin response	Narrow Leaf21, Encoding Ribosomal Protein RPS3A, Controls Leaf Development in Rice	 The nal21 mutant showed aberrant auxin responses in which multiple auxin response factors (ARFs) harboring upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) were repressed at the translational level
