NRR	 xoo 	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth
NRR	disease	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1
NRR	defense	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	Over-expression of NRR suppressed the induction of defense-related genes
NRR	defense	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	NRR:GFP (green fluorescent protein) protein was localized to the nucleus, indicating that NRR may act directly to suppress the activation of defense genes
NRR	growth	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	This phenotype was correlated with elevated NRR mRNA and protein levels and increased Xoo growth
