NRR	disease resistance	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1	Rice NRR, a negative regulator of disease resistance, interacts with Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1
NRR	root	A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth	 We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named NRR (nutrition response and root growth)| Expression of NRR in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients| Knock-down of expression of NRRa or NRRb by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth| By contrast, overexpression of NRRa in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth| These results revealed that both NRRa and NRRb played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth| Our findings suggest that NRRa and NRRb, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients|A novel rice gene, NRR responds to macronutrient deficiency and regulates root growth
