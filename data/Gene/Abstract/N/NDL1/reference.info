NA	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	2021	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657 Japan.	The molecular basis for leaf development, a major focus in developmental biology, remains unclear in the monocotyledonous grass, rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we performed a mutant screen in rice and identified an AP2-type transcription factor family protein, NARROW AND DWARF LEAF1 (NDL1). NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Loss of function of NDL1 results in bladeless leaves and SAMs that are flat, rather than dome-shaped, and lack cell proliferation activity. This loss of function also causes reduced auxin signaling. Moreover, as is the case with Arabidopsis ESR1/DRN, NDL1 plays crucial roles in shoot regeneration. Importantly, we found that NDL1 is not expressed in the SAM but is expressed in leaf primordia. We propose that NDL1 cell autonomously regulates leaf development, but non-cell autonomously regulates SAM maintenance in rice.
NA	Rice DSP controls stigma, panicle and tiller primordium initiation.	2023	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.	Tiller and seed number are key determinants of rice (Oryza sativa) yield. These traits are mainly affected by tiller, panicle, spikelet and stigma formation, but to date, no single gene involved in the development of all these organs has been identified. Here, we found a rice mutant defective stigma and panicle (dsp) with greatly reduced numbers of tillers and panicle branches, and ovaries lacking stigmas, due to defects in primordium initiation. We cloned DSP using sequencing-based mapping and verified its function with the CRISPR/Cas9 system. DSP encodes a transcription factor containing an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) domain that recognizes the GCC motif and a transcription-activating domain at the site of 244-314 that contains an angiosperm-related (AR) motif. Mutating the AR motif resulted in the dsp mutant phenotypes, whereas mutating the AP2/ERF domain led to seedling death. DSP directly regulated PINOID (PID) expression to determine the emergence of rice stigmas, and PID overexpression partially rescued the stigma defect in the dsp cr2-8 and dsp mutants. Moreover, DSP indirectly affected LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) expression to determine tiller primordium formation and synergistically regulated panicle primordium development. Our results indicated that DSP was a key regulator that modulated different genetic pathways to control the initiation of stigma primordia, the axillary meristem formation of tillers and panicle branches, which revealed their molecular mechanisms and cross-networks, laying the vital foundation for rice yield and trait improvement.
