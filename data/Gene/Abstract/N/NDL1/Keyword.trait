NDL1|DSP	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1|DSP	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 Importantly, we found that NDL1 is not expressed in the SAM but is expressed in leaf primordia
NDL1|DSP	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.

Loss of function of NDL1 results in bladeless leaves and SAMs that are flat, rather than dome-shaped, and lack cell proliferation activity
NDL1|DSP	transcription factor	Rice DSP controls stigma, panicle and tiller primordium initiation.	 DSP encodes a transcription factor containing an APETALA2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) domain that recognizes the GCC motif and a transcription-activating domain at the site of 244-314 that contains an angiosperm-related (AR) motif
NDL1|DSP	development	Rice DSP controls stigma, panicle and tiller primordium initiation.	 Moreover, DSP indirectly affected LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) expression to determine tiller primordium formation and synergistically regulated panicle primordium development

NDL1|DSP	panicle	Rice DSP controls stigma, panicle and tiller primordium initiation.	 Our results indicated that DSP was a key regulator that modulated different genetic pathways to control the initiation of stigma primordia, the axillary meristem formation of tillers and panicle branches, which revealed their molecular mechanisms and cross-networks, laying the vital foundation for rice yield and trait improvement
