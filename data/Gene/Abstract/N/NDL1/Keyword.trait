NDL1	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 Importantly, we found that NDL1 is not expressed in the SAM but is expressed in leaf primordia
NDL1	leaf	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 We propose that NDL1 cell autonomously regulates leaf development, but non-cell autonomously regulates SAM maintenance in rice
NDL1	development	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	leaf development	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	leaf development	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 We propose that NDL1 cell autonomously regulates leaf development, but non-cell autonomously regulates SAM maintenance in rice
NDL1	shoot	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	shoot	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 Moreover, as is the case with Arabidopsis ESR1/DRN, NDL1 plays crucial roles in shoot regeneration
NDL1	meristem	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	shoot apical meristem	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1	cell proliferation	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 Loss of function of NDL1 results in bladeless leaves and SAMs that are flat, rather than dome-shaped, and lack cell proliferation activity
