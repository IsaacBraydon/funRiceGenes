NDL1|DSP	SaM	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 NDL1 is the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana (subsequently called Arabidopsis) ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1 (ESR1)/DORNRÖSCHEN (DRN) and mediates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem (SAM)
NDL1|DSP	SaM	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 Importantly, we found that NDL1 is not expressed in the SAM but is expressed in leaf primordia
NDL1|DSP	SaM	NARROW AND DWARF LEAF 1, the Ortholog of Arabidopsis ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION1/DORNRÖSCHEN, Mediates Leaf Development and Maintenance of the Shoot Apical Meristem in Oryza sativa L.	 We propose that NDL1 cell autonomously regulates leaf development, but non-cell autonomously regulates SAM maintenance in rice
LAX1|BOS1	NDL1|DSP	Rice DSP controls stigma, panicle and tiller primordium initiation.	 Moreover, DSP indirectly affected LAX PANICLE1 (LAX1) expression to determine tiller primordium formation and synergistically regulated panicle primordium development
