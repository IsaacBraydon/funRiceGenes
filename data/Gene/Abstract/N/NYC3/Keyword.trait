NYC3|OsNYC3	leaf	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice	The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
NYC3|OsNYC3	senescence	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice	nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant
NYC3|OsNYC3	senescence	Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice	The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
NYC3|OsNYC3	resistance	Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.	Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.
NYC3|OsNYC3	sheath	Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.	Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.
NYC3|OsNYC3	chlorophyll	The Relationships among &quot;STAY-GREEN&quot; Trait, Post-Anthesis Assimilate Remobilization, and Grain Yield in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Here, in this study, the overexpression and RNA interference lines of gene of OsNYC3 (Non-Yellow Coloring 3), a chlorophyll catabolism gene, were investigated
