Chlorophyll degradation is an important phenomenon in the senescence process. It is necessary for the degradation of certain chlorophyll-protein complexes and thylakoid membranes during leaf senescence. Mutants retaining greenness during leaf senescence are known as 'stay-green' mutants. Non-functional type stay-green mutants, which possess defects in chlorophyll degradation, retain greenness but not leaf functionality during senescence. Here, we report a new stay-green mutant in rice, nyc3. nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant. In addition, a small amount of pheophytin a, a chlorophyll a-derivative without Mg(2+) ions in its tetrapyrrole ring, accumulated in the senescent leaves of nyc3. nyc3 shows a similar but weaker phenotype to stay green (sgr), another non-functional stay-green mutant in rice. The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr. Linkage analysis revealed that NYC3 is located near the centromere region of chromosome 6. Map-based cloning of genes near the centromere is very difficult because of the low recombination rate; however, we overcame this problem by using ionizing radiation-induced mutant alleles harboring deletions of hundreds of kilobases. Thus, it was revealed that NYC3 encodes a plastid-localizing alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein with an esterase/lipase motif. The possible function of NYC3 in the regulation of chlorophyll degradation is discussed.
NA	Characterization of a novel allele encoding pheophorbide a oxygenase in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute , Hangzhou, China.	We identified a rapid cell death 2 (rcd2) mutant from an indica cultivar Zhongjian100 mutant bank. The red-brown lesions appeared firstly on young seedling leaves, then gradually merged and the leaves completely withered at the late tillering stage. rcd2 displayed apparent cell death at/around the lesions, accumulation of superoxide anion (O2 -) and disturbed ROS scavenging system, impaired photosynthetic capacity with significantly reduced chlorophyll content. The lesion formation was controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene and induced by natural light as well as mechanical wounding. A single base mutation (A1726T) at the 6th exon of OsMH_03G0040800 resulted in I576F substitution in the encoding protein, pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO). Functional complementation could rescue the mutant phenotype and PAO-knockout lines exhibited the similar phenotype to rcd2. The activity of PAO decreased significantly while the content of PAO substrate, pheophorbide a, increased apparently in rcd2. The expression of chlorophyll synthesis/degradation-related genes and the contents of metabolic intermediates were largely changed. Furthermore, the level of chlorophyllide a, the product of chlorophyllase, increased significantly, indicating chlorophyllase might play a role in chlorophyll degradation in rice. Our results suggested that the I576F substitution disrupted PAO function, leading to O2 - accumulation and chlorophyll degradation breakdown in rice.
NA	Suppressing chlorophyll degradation by silencing OsNYC3 improves rice resistance to Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight.	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education/ Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Agricultural College of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia solani KÃ¼hn (R. solani) causes serious diseases in many crops worldwide, including rice and maize sheath blight (ShB). Crop resistance to the fungus is a quantitative trait and resistance mechanism remains largely unknown, severely hindering the progress on developing resistant varieties. In this study, we found that resistant variety YSBR1 has apparently stronger ability to suppress the expansion of R. solani than susceptible Lemont in both field and growth chamber conditions. Comparison of transcriptomic profiles shows that the photosynthetic system including chlorophyll biosynthesis is highly suppressed by R. solani in Lemont but weakly in YSBR1. YSBR1 shows higher chlorophyll content than that of Lemont, and inducing chlorophyll degradation by dark treatment significantly reduces its resistance. Furthermore, three rice mutants and one maize mutant that carry impaired chlorophyll biosynthesis all display enhanced susceptibility to R. solani. Overexpression of OsNYC3, a chlorophyll degradation gene apparently induced expression by R. solani infection, significantly enhanced ShB susceptibility in a high-yield ShB-susceptible variety &#39;9522&#39;. However, silencing its transcription apparently improves ShB resistance without compromising agronomic traits or yield in field tests. Interestingly, altering chlorophyll content does not affect rice resistance to blight and blast diseases, caused by biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens, respectively. Our study reveals that chlorophyll plays an important role in ShB resistance and suppressing chlorophyll degradation induced by R. solani infection apparently improves rice ShB resistance. This discovery provides a novel target for developing resistant crop to necrotrophic fungus R.solani.
NA	The Relationships among &quot;STAY-GREEN&quot; Trait, Post-Anthesis Assimilate Remobilization, and Grain Yield in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2022	Int J Mol Sci	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Cultivation and Physiology, Agricultural College, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou 225009, China.	The mobilization and translocation of carbohydrates and mineral nutrients from vegetative plant parts to grains are pivotal for grain filling, often involving a whole plant senescence process. Loss of greenness is a hallmark of leaf senescence. However, the relationship between crop yield and senescence has been controversial for many years. Here, in this study, the overexpression and RNA interference lines of gene of OsNYC3 (Non-Yellow Coloring 3), a chlorophyll catabolism gene, were investigated. Furthermore, exogenous phytohormones were applied, and a treatment of alternate wetting and moderate drying (AWMD) was introduced to regulate the processes of leaf senescence. The results indicated that the delayed senescence of the &quot;STAY-GREEN&quot; trait of rice is undesirable for the process of grain filling, and it would cause a lower ratio of grain filling and lower grain weight of inferior grains, because of unused assimilates in the stems and leaves. Through the overexpression of OsNYC3, application of exogenous chemicals of abscisic acid (ABA), and water management of AWMD, leaf photosynthesis was less influenced, a high ratio of carbohydrate assimilates was partitioned to grains other than leaves and stems as labeled by (13)C, grain filling was improved, especially for inferior spikelets, and activities of starch-synthesizing enzymes were enhanced. However, application of ethephon not only accelerated leaf senescence, but also caused seed abortion and grain weight reduction. Thus, plant senescence needs to be finely adjusted in order to make a contribution to crop productivity.
