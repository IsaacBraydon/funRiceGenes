NA	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	2022	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Pathology, College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, China.	Phytochrome (Phy)-regulated light signalling plays important roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, its function in rice defence against sheath blight disease (ShB) remains unclear. Here, we found that PhyB mutation or shade treatment promoted rice resistance to ShB, while resistance was reduced by PhyB overexpression. Further analysis showed that PhyB interacts with phytochrome-interacting factor-like 15 (PIL15), brassinazole resistant 1 (BZR1), and vascular plant one-zinc-finger 2 (VOZ2). Plants overexpressing PIL15 were more susceptible to ShB in contrast to bzr1-D-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type, suggesting that PhyB may inhibit BZR1 to negatively regulate rice resistance to ShB. Although BZR1 is known to regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signalling, the observation that BR signalling negatively regulated resistance to ShB indicated an independent role for BZR1 in controlling rice resistance. It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB. RNA sequencing showed that cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 8B (CAD8B), involved in and NAC028-overexpressing plants compared with the wild-type. Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly. Taken together, the analyses demonstrated that PhyB-mediated light signalling inhibits the BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B pathway to regulate rice resistance to ShB.
NA	bZIP23 interacts with NAC028 to modulate rice resistance to sheath blight disease.	2023	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China; College of Plant Protection, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, China.	Rice sheath blight disease (ShB) is a serious threat to rice production, and breeding ShB-resistance varieties is the most effective strategy for ShB control. However, the molecular mechanisms of rice resistance to ShB are largely unknown. In this study, the NAC transcription factor NAC028 was shown to be sensitive to ShB infection. ShB inoculation assays revealed that NAC028 is a positive regulator of ShB resistance. To elucidate the molecular basis of NAC028-mediated ShB resistance, another transcription factor (bZIP23) was identified as a NAC028-interacting protein. Results of the transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CAD8B, a key enzyme for lignin biosynthesis and ShB resistance, is regulated by both bZIP23 and NAC028. The combination of the yeast-one hybrid, ChIP-qPCR, and transactivation assays illustrated that both bZIP23 and NAC028 directly bind the CAD8B promoter and activate its expression. The transcriptional connection between bZIP23 and NAC028 was also investigated and the results of in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that NAC028 was one of the target genes of bZIP23, but not vice versa. The results presented here provide new insights into the molecular basis of ShB resistance and contribute to the potential targets for the ShB resistance breeding program.
