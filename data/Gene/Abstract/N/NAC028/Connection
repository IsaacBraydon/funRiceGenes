NAC028	OsBZR1|BZR1	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB
NAC028	OsBZR1|BZR1	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly
NAC028	SMOS1|SHB|RLA1|NGR5	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 It was also found that the BZR1 ligand NAC028 positively regulated resistance to ShB
