NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsPHR3	OsPHR3 affects the traits governing nitrogen homeostasis in rice.	 During vegetative growth phase, compared with the wild-type, OsPHR3 mutants showed significant variations in the adventitious root development, influx rates of 15N-NO3- and 15N-NH4+, concentrations of total N, NO3- and NH4+ in different tissues, and the relative expression levels of OsNRT1
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.	 Indica OsNR2 also promotes NO3- uptake via feed-forward interaction with OsNRT1
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.	 These properties enable indica OsNR2 to confer increased effective tiller number, grain yield and NUE on japonica rice, effects enhanced by interaction with an additionally introgressed indica OsNRT1
