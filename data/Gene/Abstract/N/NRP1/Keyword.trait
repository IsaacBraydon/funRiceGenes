NRP1	photosynthesis	Knocking out a negative regulator of photosynthesis 1 (NRP1) increases rice leaf photosynthesis and biomass production in the field	 The NRP1 showed significantly negative correlation with the expression of many genes involved in photosynthesis
NRP1	photosynthesis	Knocking out a negative regulator of photosynthesis 1 (NRP1) increases rice leaf photosynthesis and biomass production in the field	 Knocking out NPR1 led to greater photosynthesis and increased biomass in the field, while overexpression of NRP1 decreased photosynthesis and biomass
NRP1	photosynthesis	Knocking out a negative regulator of photosynthesis 1 (NRP1) increases rice leaf photosynthesis and biomass production in the field	 Protein transactivation experiments show that NRP1 is a transcription activator, implying that NRP1 may indirectly regulate photosynthesis gene expression through an unknown regulator
NRP1	biomass	Knocking out a negative regulator of photosynthesis 1 (NRP1) increases rice leaf photosynthesis and biomass production in the field	 Knocking out NPR1 led to greater photosynthesis and increased biomass in the field, while overexpression of NRP1 decreased photosynthesis and biomass
NRP1	transcription activator	Knocking out a negative regulator of photosynthesis 1 (NRP1) increases rice leaf photosynthesis and biomass production in the field	 Protein transactivation experiments show that NRP1 is a transcription activator, implying that NRP1 may indirectly regulate photosynthesis gene expression through an unknown regulator
