Leaf morphology and spikelet number are two important traits associated with grain yield. To understand how genes coordinating with sink and sources of cereal crops is important for grain yield improvement guidance. Although many researches focus on leaf morphology or grain number in rice, the regulating molecular mechanisms are still unclear.In this study, we identified a prohibitin complex 2Î± subunit, NAL8, that contributes to multiple developmental process and is required for normal leaf width and spikelet number at the reproductive stage in rice. These results were consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern of NAL8 gene. We used genetic complementation, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system, RNAi gene silenced system and overexpressing system to generate transgenic plants for confirming the fuctions of NAL8. Mutation of NAL8 causes a reduction in the number of plastoglobules and shrunken thylakoids in chloroplasts, resulting in reduced cell division. In addition, the auxin levels in nal8 mutants are higher than in TQ, while the cytokinin levels are lower than in TQ. Moreover, RNA-sequencing and proteomics analysis shows that NAL8 is involved in multiple hormone signaling pathways as well as photosynthesis in chloroplasts and respiration in mitochondria.Our findings provide new insights into the way that NAL8 functions as a molecular chaperone in regulating plant leaf morphology and spikelet number through its effects on mitochondria and chloroplasts associated with cell division.
