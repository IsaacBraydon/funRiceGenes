NBIP1	protoplasts	Nitrate-NRT1.1B-SPX4 cascade integrates nitrogen and phosphorus signalling networks in plants 	Moreover, NBIP1 significantly promoted the degradation of eGFP¨CSPX4 in protoplasts of wild-type plants (Fig. 6f), whereas this process was repressed in protoplasts of the nrt1.1b mutant (Supplementary Fig. 10).
