NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1
NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i
NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation
NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro
NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice
NOL	NYC1	Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence	Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro
NOL	NYC1	Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence	We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions
NYC1	ONAC106	Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.	Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
NYC1	RIM1|ONAC054	Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound ONAC054 is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.	 Genome-wide microarray analysis showed that ABA signaling-associated genes, including ABA INSENSITIVE5 (OsABI5) and senescence-associated genes, including STAY-GREEN and NON-YELLOW COLORING1 (NYC1), were significantly downregulated in onac054 mutants
NYC1	RIM1|ONAC054	Multilayered regulation of membrane-bound ONAC054 is essential for abscisic acid-induced leaf senescence in rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation and protoplast transient assays showed that ONAC054 directly activates OsABI5 and NYC1 by binding to the mitochondrial dysfunction motif in their promoters
