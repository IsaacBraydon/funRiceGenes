NOL	NYC1	Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice	 Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1| In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i| The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation| Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro| These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice
NOL	NYC1	Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence	 Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro| We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions
