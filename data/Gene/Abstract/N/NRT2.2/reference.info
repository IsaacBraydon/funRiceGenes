2052.pdf	Knockdown of a rice stelar nitrate transporter alters long-distance translocation but not root influx	2012	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement and Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	Root nitrate uptake is well known to adjust to the plant's nitrogen demand for growth. Long-distance transport and/or root storage pools are thought to provide negative feedback signals regulating root uptake. We have characterized a vascular specific nitrate transporter belonging to the high-affinity Nitrate Transporter2 (NRT2) family, OsNRT2.3a, in rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica 'Nipponbare'). Localization analyses using protoplast expression, in planta promoter-beta-glucuronidase assay, and in situ hybridization showed that OsNRT2.3a was located in the plasma membrane and mainly expressed in xylem parenchyma cells of the stele of nitrate-supplied roots. Knockdown expression of OsNRT2.3a by RNA interference (RNAi) had impaired xylem loading of nitrate and decreased plant growth at low (0.5 mm) nitrate supply. In comparison with the wild type, the RNAi lines contained both nitrate and total nitrogen significantly higher in the roots and lower in the shoots. The short-term [(15)N]NO(3)(-) influx (5 min) in entire roots and NO(3)(-) fluxes in root surfaces showed that the knockdown of OsNRT2.3a in comparison with the wild type did not affect nitrate uptake by roots. The RNAi plants showed no significant changes in the expression of some root nitrate transporters (OsNRT2.3b, OsNRT2.4, and OsNAR2.1), but transcripts for nia1 (nitrate reductase) had increased and OsNRT2.1 and OsNRT2.2 had decreased when the plants were supplied with nitrate. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNRT2.3a plays a key role in long-distance nitrate transport from root to shoot at low nitrate supply level in rice.
Feng-2011-Spatial expression a.pdf	Spatial expression and regulation of rice high-affinity nitrate transporters by nitrogen and carbon status	2011	J Exp Bot	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, PR China. ghxu@njau.edu.cn	The high affinity nitrate transport system (HATS) plays an important role in rice nitrogen acquisition because, even under flooded anaerobic cultivation when NH(4)(+) dominates, significant nitrification occurs on the root surface. In the rice genome, four NRT2 and two NAR2 genes encoding HATS components have been identified. One gene OsNRT2.3 was mRNA spliced into OsNRT2.3a and OsNRT2.3b and OsNAR2.1 interacts with OsNRT2.1/2.2 and OsNRT2.3a to provide nitrate uptake. Using promoter-GUS reporter plants and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses, it was observed that OsNAR2.1 was expressed mainly in the root epidermal cells, differently from the five OsNRT2 genes. OsNAR2.1, OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2, and OsNRT2.3a were up-regulated by nitrate and suppressed by NH(4)(+) and high root temperature (37 degrees C). Expression of all these genes was increased by light or external sugar supply. Root transcripts of OsNRT2.3b and OsNRT2.4 were much less abundant and not affected by temperature. Expression of OsNRT2.3b was insensitive to the form of N supply. Expression of OsNRT2.4 responded to changes in auxin supply unlike all the other NRT2 genes. A region from position -311 to -1, relative to the translation start site in the promoter region of OsNAR2.1, was found to contain the cis-element(s) necessary for the nitrate-, but not light- and sugar-dependent activation. However, it was difficult to define a conserved cis-element in the promoters of the nitrate-regulated OsNRT2/OsNAR2 genes. The results imply distinct physiological functions for each OsNRT2 transporter, and differential regulation pathways by N and C status.

Plants take up both nitrate and ammonium as main nitrogen (N) sources. Although ammonium is the predominant form in anaerobic-flooded paddy soil, it has been proposed that rice and other wetland plants may take up significant amounts of nitrate formed by nitrification of ammonium in the rhizosphere. A two-component system for nitrate transport including NRT2s with a partner protein (NAR2 or NRT3.1) has been identified in Arabidopsis. We report the physiological function of another member of the NAR2 family, OsNAR2.1 in rice (Oryza sativa, ssp. Japonica, cv. Nipponbare). OsNAR2.1 was mainly expressed in roots and induced by nitrate and suppressed by ammonium and some amino acids. Knockdown of OsNAR2.1 by RNA interference synchronously suppressed expression of OsNRT2.1, OsNRT2.2 and OsNRT2.3a in the osnar2.1mutants. Both high- and low-affinity nitrate transports were greatly impaired by OsNAR2.1 knockdown. Yeast two hybridization showed that OsNAR2.1 not only interacted with OsNRT2.1/OsNRT2.2, but also with OsNRT2.3a. Taken together, the data demonstrate that OsNAR2.1 plays a key role in enabling the plant to cope with variable nitrate supply.
Takayanagi-2011-High-affinity nitrat.pdf	High-affinity nitrate uptake by rice (Oryza sativa) coleoptiles	2011	J Plant Res	Graduate School of Environmental Science, University of Shiga Prefecture, 2500 Hassaka-cho, Hikone, Shiga 522-8533, Japan.	Nitrate uptake by rice coleoptiles was evaluated using (1)(5)N-nitrate in relation to the expression of high-affinity nitrate uptake-related genes, OsNRT2s (OsNRT2.1-2.4) and OsNAR2s (OsNAR2.1 and 2.2). Apparent nitrate uptake by coleoptiles was about one-sixth of that by hydroponically cultured seedling roots. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsNRT2.1, a root-specific key gene of inducible high-affinity transport system for nitrate, was most strongly induced in coleoptiles following nitrate supply initiation, while other OsNRT2s and OsNAR2s showed modest induction. These results suggest that rice coleoptiles may have high-affinity transport systems for nitrate similar to roots, and can be model organs for nutrient uptake by submerged plant shoots.
NA	Reducing phenanthrene uptake and translocation, and accumulation in the seeds by overexpressing OsNRT2.3b in rice	2020	Sci Total Environ	Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China; College of Horticulture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China.	The uptake and accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in crops have gained much attention due to their toxicity to humans. Nitrogen (N) is an essential element for plant growth and has also been implicated in the acquisition and acropetal translocation of PAHs. OsNRT2.3b encodes a nitrate (NO3-) transporter that is involved in the acquisition and mobilization of N in rice. Here, we investigated whether overexpression of OsNRT2.3b would exert any mitigating influence on the uptake and translocation of phenanthrene (Phe, a model PAH) in transgenic rice (Oryza sativa). The wild-type seedlings exhibited a reduction in plant height, primary root length, and shoot biomass when grown hydroponically in a medium supplemented with Phe. Acquisition of Phe by the roots and its subsequent translocation to shoots increased concomitantly with an increase in Phe concentration in the medium and duration of the treatment. OsNRT2.3b-overexpressing lines (Ox-6 and Ox-8) were generated independently. Compared with the wild-type, the concentration of Phe in Ox-6 and Ox-8 were significantly lower in the roots (47%-54%) and shoots (22%-31%) grown hydroponically with Phe (1 mg/L). Further, the wild-type and Ox lines were grown to maturity in a pot soil under Phe conditions and the concentrations of Phe and total N were assayed in the culms and flag leaves. Compared with the wild-type, in Ox lines the concentration of total N significantly increased in the culms (288%-366%) and flag leaves (12%-25%), while that of Phe significantly reduced in the culms (25%-28%) and flag leaves (18%-21%). The results revealed an antagonistic correlation between the concentration of total N and Phe. The concentration of Phe was also significantly lower (29%-38%) in the seeds of Ox lines than the wild-type. The study highlighted the efficacy of overexpressing OsNRT2.3b in mitigating the Phe toxicity by attenuating its acquisition, mobilization, and allocation to the seeds.  Keywords:
