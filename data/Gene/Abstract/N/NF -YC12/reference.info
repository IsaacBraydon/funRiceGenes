China.	Identification of seed development regulatory genes is the key for the genetic improvement of rice grain quality. NF-Ys are important transcription factors, but their roles in rice grain quality control and the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report the functional characterization a rice NF-Y heterotrimer complex NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144, which is formed by the binding of NF-YB1 to NF-YC12 and then bHLH144 in a sequential order. Knock-out of each of the complex genes resulted in alteration of grain qualities in all the mutants as well as reduced grain size in crnf-yb1 and crnf-yc12. RNA-seq analysis identified 1496 genes that were commonly-regulated by NF-YB1 and NF-YC12, including the key granule-bound starch synthase gene Wx. NF-YC12 and bHLH144 maintain NF-YB1 stability from the degradation mediated by ubiquitin/26S proteasome, while NF-YB1 directly binds to the &quot;G-box&quot; domain of Wx promoter and activates Wx transcription, hence to regulate rice grain quality. In all, we revealed a novel grain quality regulatory pathway controlled by NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex, which has great potential for rice genetic improvement. This article is protected by copyright.
