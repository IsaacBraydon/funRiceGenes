NA	NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou, 311400, P.R. China.	Identification of seed development regulatory genes is the key for the genetic improvement of rice grain quality. NF-Ys are important transcription factors, but their roles in rice grain quality control and the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report the functional characterization a rice NF-Y heterotrimer complex NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144, which is formed by the binding of NF-YB1 to NF-YC12 and then bHLH144 in a sequential order. Knock-out of each of the complex genes resulted in alteration of grain qualities in all the mutants as well as reduced grain size in crnf-yb1 and crnf-yc12. RNA-seq analysis identified 1496 genes that were commonly-regulated by NF-YB1 and NF-YC12, including the key granule-bound starch synthase gene Wx. NF-YC12 and bHLH144 maintain NF-YB1 stability from the degradation mediated by ubiquitin/26S proteasome, while NF-YB1 directly binds to the &quot;G-box&quot; domain of Wx promoter and activates Wx transcription, hence to regulate rice grain quality. In all, we revealed a novel grain quality regulatory pathway controlled by NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex, which has great potential for rice genetic improvement. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	NF-YC12 is a key multi-functional regulator of accumulation of seed storage substances in rice.	2019	J Exp Bot	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	Starch and storage proteins, the primary storage substances of cereal endosperm, are a major source of food for humans. However, the transcriptional regulatory networks of the synthesis and accumulation of storage substances remain largely unknown. Here, we identified a rice endosperm-specific gene, NF-YC12, that encodes a putative nuclear factor-Y transcription factor subunit C. NF-YC12 is expressed in the aleurone layer and starchy endosperm during grain development. Knockout of NF-YC12 significantly decreased grain weight as well as altering starch and protein accumulation and starch granule formation. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that in the nf-yc12 mutant genes related to starch biosynthesis and the metabolism of energy reserves were enriched in the down-regulated category. In addition, starch and protein contents in seeds differed between NF-YC12-overexpression lines and the wild-type. NF-YC12 was found to interact with NF-YB1. ChIP-qPCR and yeast one-hybrid assays showed that NF-YC12 regulated the rice sucrose transporter OsSUT1 in coordination with NF-YB1 in the aleurone layer. In addition, NF-YC12 was directly bound to the promoters of FLO6 (FLOURY ENDOSPERM6) and OsGS1;3 (glutamine synthetase1) in developing endosperm. This study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving NF-YC12, which coordinates multiple pathways to regulate endosperm development and the accumulation of storage substances in rice seeds.
NA	Transcription factor OsNF-YB9 regulates reproductive growth and development in rice.	2019	Planta	National Institute of Plant Genome Research, New Delhi, 110067, India.	OsNF-YB9 controls heading by affecting expression of regulators of flowering. It affects the development of the reproductive meristem by interacting with MADS1 and controlling expression of hormone-related genes. Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) family of transcription factors takes part in many aspects of growth and development in eukaryotes. They have been classified into three subunit classes, namely, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. In plants, this transcription factor family is much diverged and takes part in several developmental processes and stress. We investigated NF-Y subunit genes of rice (Oryza sativa) and found OsNF-YB9 as the closest homologue of LEAFY COTYLEDON1. OsNF-YB9 delayed the heading date when ectopically expressed in rice. Expression of several heading date regulating genes such as Hd1, Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 were altered. OsNF-YB9 overexpression also resulted in morphological defects in the reproductive organs and led to pseudovivipary. OsNF-YB9 interacted with MADS1, a key regulator of floral development. This NF-Y subunit acted upstream to several transcription factors as well as signalling proteins involved in brassinosteroid and gibberellic acid metabolism and cell cycle. OsNF-YB9 and OsNF-YC12 interacted in planta and the latter also delayed heading in rice upon overexpression suggesting its involvement in a similar pathway. Our data provide new insights into the rice heading date pathway integrating these OsNF-Y subunit members to the network. These features can be exploited to improve vegetative growth and yield of rice plants in future.
