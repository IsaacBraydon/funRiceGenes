Non-expresser of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) is the master regulator of salicylic acid-mediated systemic acquired resistance. Over-expression of Arabidopsis NPR1 and rice NH1 (NPR1 homolog1)/OsNPR1 in rice results in enhanced resistance. While there are four rice NPR1 paralogs in the rice genome, none have been demonstrated to function in disease resistance. To study rice NPR1 paralog 3, we introduced constructs into rice and tested for effects on resistance to infection by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), the causal agent of bacterial blight. While over-expression of NH3 using the maize ubiquitin-1 promoter failed to enhance resistance, introduction of an extra copy of NH3 driven by its own promoter (nNT-NH3) resulted in clear, enhanced resistance. Progeny analysis confirms that the enhanced resistance phenotype, measured by Xoo-induced lesion length, is associated with the NH3 transgene. Bacterial growth curve analysis indicates that bacterial population levels are reduced 10-fold in nNT-NH3 lines compared to control rice lines. The transgenic plants exhibit higher sensitivity to benzothiadiazole (BTH) and 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) treatment as measured by increased cell death. Expression analysis of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes showed that nNT-NH3 plants display greatly enhanced induction of PR genes only after treatment with BTH. Our study demonstrates an alternative method to employ a regulatory protein to enhance plant defence. This approach avoids using undesirable constitutive, high-level expression and may prove to be more practical for engineering resistance.
NA	OsNPR3.3-dependent salicylic acid signaling is involved in recessive gene xa5-mediated immunity to rice bacterial blight.	2020	Sci Rep	Center for Molecular Agrobiology,Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Salicylic acid (SA) is a key natural component that mediates local and systemic resistance to pathogens in many dicotyledonous species. However, its function is controversial in disease resistance in rice plants. Here, we show that the SA signaling is involved in both pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns triggered immunity (PTI) and effector triggered immunity (ETI) to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae (Xoo) mediated by the recessive gene xa5, in which OsNPR3.3 plays an important role through interacting with TGAL11. Rice plants containing homozygous xa5 gene respond positively to exogenous SA, and their endogenous SA levels are also especially induced upon infection by the Xoo strain, PXO86. Depletion of endogenous SA can significantly attenuate plant resistance to PXO86, even to 86<U+2206>HrpXG (mutant PXO86 with a damaged type III secretion system). These results indicated that SA plays an important role in disease resistance in rice plants, which can be clouded by high levels of endogenous SA and the use of particular rice varieties.
