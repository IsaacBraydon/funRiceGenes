NADP-ME2|OsNADP-ME2	growth	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited
NADP-ME2|OsNADP-ME2	seedling	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited
NADP-ME2|OsNADP-ME2	salt	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	 These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses
NADP-ME2|OsNADP-ME2	salt	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	 These results suggest that NADP-ME2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress
NADP-ME2|OsNADP-ME2	root	Expression of an NADP-malic enzyme gene in rice (Oryza sativa. L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	 Expression of NADP-ME2 mRNA in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3, NaCl, and environmental pH changes
