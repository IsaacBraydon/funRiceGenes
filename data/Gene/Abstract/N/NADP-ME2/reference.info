L) is induced by environmental stresses; over-expression of the gene in Arabidopsis confers salt and osmotic stress tolerance	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Alkali Soil Natural Environmental Science Center (ASNESC), Stress Molecular Biology Laboratory, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin 150040, P. R. China.	NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40) functions in many different pathways in plants, and has recently been implicated in plant defense such as in responses to wounding and UV-B radiation. In this study, we isolated a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone by using the differential display method and screening of a root cDNA library of rice (Oryza sativa. L) under carbonate (NaHCO3) stress, and identified it as one of the rice NADP-ME genes (we named it NADP-ME2, GenBank accession no. AB053295). The 5' end of NADP-ME2 was obtained by the 5'-RACE method, and the full-length cDNA had a length of 2217 bp encoding 593 amino acids. Expression of NADP-ME2 mRNA in roots was induced by stress from carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3, NaCl, and environmental pH changes. NADP-ME2 transcripts increased during 72-h exposures to NaHCO3, NaCl, and PEG stresses. Furthermore, NADP-ME activities in leaves and roots of rice seedlings increased by more than 50% in the presence of carbonates (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), NaCl, and PEG. These results indicate that rice NADP-ME2 responds to salts and osmotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 were obtained through transformation, screening, Northern analysis and in situ NADP-ME activity assay. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing NADP-ME2 grew well in 1/2 x MS medium with 100 mM NaCl or 4% mannitol, whereas growth of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis seedlings was strongly inhibited. In addition, under 125 mM NaCl stress, the root lengths of transgenic lines were about twice as long as those of the WT. These results suggest that NADP-ME2 has a role in enhancing tolerance of plants to salt and osmotic stress.
NA	Magnaporthe oryzae Effector AVR-Pii Helps to Establish Compatibility by Inhibition of the Rice NADP-Malic Enzyme Resulting in Disruption of Oxidative Burst and Host Innate Immunity.	2016	Mol Cells	Division of Integrative Bioscience and Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Sejong University, Seoul 143-747, Korea.	Plant disease resistance occurs as a hypersensitive response (HR) at the site of attempted pathogen invasion. This specific event is initiated in response to recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and subsequent PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Both PTI and ETI mechanisms are tightly connected with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and disease resistance that involves distinct biphasic ROS production as one of its pivotal plant immune responses. This unique oxidative burst is strongly dependent on the resistant cultivars because a monophasic ROS burst is a hallmark of the susceptible cultivars. However, the cause of the differential ROS burst remains unknown. In the study here, we revealed the plausible underlying mechanism of the differential ROS burst through functional understanding of the Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae) AVR effector, AVR-Pii. We performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using AVRPii as bait and isolated rice NADP-malic enzyme2 (Os-NADP-ME2) as the rice target protein. To our surprise, deletion of the rice Os-NADP-ME2 gene in a resistant rice cultivar disrupted innate immunity against the rice blast fungus. Malic enzyme activity and inhibition studies demonstrated that AVR-Pii proteins specifically inhibit in vitro NADP-ME activity. Overall, we demonstrate that rice blast fungus, M. oryzae attenuates the host ROS burst via AVR-Pii-mediated inhibition of Os-NADP-ME2, which is indispensable in ROS metabolism for the innate immunity of rice. This characterization of the regulation of the host oxidative burst will help to elucidate how the products of AVR genes function associated with virulence of the pathogen.
NA	Iron- and Reactive Oxygen Species-Dependent Ferroptotic Cell Death in Rice-Magnaporthe oryzae Interactions.	2018	Plant Cell	Sejong University CITY: Seoul Korea (South), Republic Of.	Hypersensitive response (HR) cell death is the most effective plant immune response to restrict fungal pathogen invasion. Here, we report that incompatible rice-Magnaporthe oryzae interactions induce iron- and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent ferroptotic cell death in rice cells. Ferric ions and ROS (hydrogen peroxide) accumulated in HR cell death of rice leaf sheath tissues during avirulent M. oryzae infection. By contrast, iron did not accumulate in rice cells during virulent M. oryzae infection or treatment with the fungal elicitor chitin. Avirulent M. oryzae infection in ¦¤Os-nadp-me 2-3 mutant rice did not trigger iron and ROS accumulation and suppressed HR cell death, suggesting that NADP-malic enzyme 2 is required for ferroptotic cell death in rice. Small-molecule ferroptosis inhibitors deferoxamine, ferrostatin-1 and cytochalasin E, and NADPH-oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium suppressed iron-dependent ROS accumulation and lipid peroxidation to completely attenuate HR cell death in rice sheaths during avirulent M. oryzae infection. By contrast, the small-molecule inducer erastin triggered iron-dependent ROS accumulation and glutathione depletion, which ultimately led to HR cell death in rice in response to virulent M. oryzae. These combined results demonstrate that iron- and ROS-dependent signaling cascades are involved in the ferroptotic cell death pathway in rice to disrupt M. oryzae infection.
