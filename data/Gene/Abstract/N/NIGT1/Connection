CycB1;1|OsCycB1;1	NIGT1	NIGT1 represses plant growth and mitigates phosphate starvation signaling to balance the growth response tradeoff in rice.	 We further demonstrate that NIGT1 constrains shoot growth by repressing the expression of growth-related regulatory genes, including brassinolide signal transduction master regulator BZR1, cell division regulator CYCB1;1, and DNA replication regulator PSF3
