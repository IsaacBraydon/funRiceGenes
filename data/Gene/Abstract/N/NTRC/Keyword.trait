NTRC	oxidative	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	 We propose that NTRC constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power
NTRC	oxidative	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power
NTRC	oxidative	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage
NTRC	photosynthesis	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light
NTRC	chloroplast	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	We show that rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast NADPH THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRC), with a thioredoxin domain, uses NADPH to reduce the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide

NTRC	phosphate	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power
NTRC	senescence	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by light/dark incubation produced an increase in hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in leaves and accelerated senescence of NTRC-deficient plants
