NBS-LRR	OsWRKY6	The OsWRKY6 transcriptional cascade functions in basal defense and Xa1-mediated defense of rice against Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae.	 Here, we characterized a transcriptional cascade triggered by OsWRKY6 that regulated defense against Xoo infection mediated by the NBS-LRR protein Xa1
NBS-LRR	Pb2	Genome-Wide Association Study Identifies a Rice Panicle Blast Resistance Gene, Pb2, Encoding NLR Protein.	 Pb2 encodes a typical NBS-LRR protein with NB-ARC domain and LRR domain
