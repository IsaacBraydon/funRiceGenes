NOG1	grain	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.
NOG1	grain	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.	 NOG1 can significantly increase the grain yield of commercial high-yield varieties: introduction of NOG1 increases the grain yield by 25
NOG1	grain	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.	8% in the NOG1-deficient rice cultivar Zhonghua 17, and overexpression of NOG1 can further increase the grain yield by 19
NOG1	grain	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.	 Interestingly, NOG1 plays a prominent role in increasing grain number, but does not change heading date or seed-setting rate
