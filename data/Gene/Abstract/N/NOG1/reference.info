NA	NOG1 increases grain production in rice.	2017	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.	During rice domestication and improvement, increasing grain yield to meet human needs was the primary objective. Rice grain yield is a quantitative trait determined by multiple genes, but the molecular basis for increased grain yield is still unclear. Here, we show that NUMBER OF GRAINS 1 (NOG1), which encodes an enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase, increases the grain yield of rice by enhancing grain number per panicle without a negative effect on the number of panicles per plant or grain weight. NOG1 can significantly increase the grain yield of commercial high-yield varieties: introduction of NOG1 increases the grain yield by 25.8% in the NOG1-deficient rice cultivar Zhonghua 17, and overexpression of NOG1 can further increase the grain yield by 19.5% in the NOG1-containing variety Teqing. Interestingly, NOG1 plays a prominent role in increasing grain number, but does not change heading date or seed-setting rate. Our findings suggest that NOG1 could be used to increase rice production.
NA	The grain yield regulator NOG1 plays a dual role in latitudinal adaptation and cold tolerance during rice domestication.	2022	Front Genet	Guangdong Key Laboratory of New Technology in Rice Breeding, Guangdong Rice Engineering Laboratory, Rice Research Institute, Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Guangzhou, China.	Rice originated in tropical and subtropical regions and is distributed worldwide. Low temperature is one of the most critical abiotic stresses affecting grain yield and geographical distribution of rice. It is vital to elucidate the molecular mechanism of chilling tolerance in rice for ensuring cereals production. Previously we isolated the domestication-related gene NOG1 which affects rice grain number and yield. In this study, we specified that rice varieties harboring high-yielding NOG1 allele are more distributed in low-latitude regions. Additionally, we observed NOG1 influences the chilling tolerance of rice. Through genome-wide transcriptional analysis after cold treatment at 10Â°C, there were 717 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in nog1 near-isogenic lines compared with the control Guichao 2, including 432 up-regulated DEGs and 284 down-regulated DEGs. Gene ontology annotations and KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs showed that various biological processes and signaling pathways were related to cold stress, such as lipid metabolism and genetic information processing. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of chilling tolerance in rice and the molecular basis of environmental adaptation during rice domestication.
