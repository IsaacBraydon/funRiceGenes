NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like serine and cysteine protease, interacted with FZP and promoted FZP degradation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Consistently, down-regulating FZP expression or up-regulating NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant
