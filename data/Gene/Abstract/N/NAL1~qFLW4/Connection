NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	In this paper, we examined the function of four genes that regulate the width of the leaf blade and the vein number: NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), NAL2, NAL3 and NAL7
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Genetic analysis of rice mutants responsible for narrow leaf phenotype and reduced vein number.	The nal7 mutation showed additive effects on both leaf width and vein number, when combined with the nal1 single or the nal2 nal3 double mutation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Functional analyses showed that NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1), a trypsin-like serine and cysteine protease, interacted with FZP and promoted FZP degradation
FZP|BFL1|SGDP7	NAL1|qFLW4	Variation in FZP regulatory region causes increases of inflorescence secondary branches and grain yield in rice domestication.	 Consistently, down-regulating FZP expression or up-regulating NAL1 expression in commercial cultivar Zhonghua 17 increased secondary branches per panicle, grain number per panicle, and grain yield per plant
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 Although the NAL1 and GNP1 genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Based on DNA sequences of these two genes in 198 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and 8-10 wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) germplasms, 16 and 14 haplotypes were identified for NAL1 and GNP1, respectively
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 Compared with the transgenic lines with GNP1 or NAL1, the transgenic lines with both genes had a higher GNP (15
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	Our results indicated that the GNP1 and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars
NAL1|qFLW4	OsGA20ox1|GNP1|SDSFL1	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	 These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding GNP1 and NAL1
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	 To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	 Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type
NAL1|qFLW4	OsFMO|OsCOW1|NAL7	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	 The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant
