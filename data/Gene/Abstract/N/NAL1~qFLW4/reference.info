10.1007-s00299-011-1207-7.pdf	Fine mapping of a major QTL for flag leaf width in rice, qFLW4, which might be caused by alternative splicing of NAL1	2012	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Leaf width is an important agricultural trait in rice. QTL mapping in a recombinant inbred line population derived from the cross between the javanica cultivar D50 (narrow-leaved) and the indica cultivar HB277 (wide-leaved) identified five QTLs controlling flag leaf width. Fine mapping of the major QTL qFLW4 narrowed its location to a 74.8 kb interval between the SSR loci RM17483 and RM17486, a region which also contains the gene NAL1 (Narrow leaf 1). There was no difference in the level of NAL1 expression between cvs. D50 and HB277, but an analysis of the NAL1 transcripts showed that while most (if not all) of those produced in cv. D50 were full-length, two-thirds of those in HB277 were non-functional due to either loss or gain of sequence. The inference was that NAL1 is probably synonymous with qFLW4, and that the functional difference between the two alleles was due to alternative splicing. The analysis of expression of other known genes involved in the determination of leaf width provided no evidence of their having any clear functional association with qFLW4/NAL1.
Plant Physiol.-2008-Qi-1947-59.pdf	Mutation of the rice Narrow leaf1 gene, which encodes a novel protein, affects vein patterning and polar auxin transport	2008	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	The size and shape of the plant leaf is an important agronomic trait. To understand the molecular mechanism governing plant leaf shape, we characterized a classic rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant named narrow leaf1 (nal1), which exhibits a characteristic phenotype of narrow leaves. In accordance with reduced leaf blade width, leaves of nal1 contain a decreased number of longitudinal veins. Anatomical investigations revealed that the culms of nal1 also show a defective vascular system, in which the number and distribution pattern of vascular bundles are altered. Map-based cloning and genetic complementation analyses demonstrated that Nal1 encodes a plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function. We provide evidence showing that Nal1 is richly expressed in vascular tissues and that mutation of this gene leads to significantly reduced polar auxin transport capacity. These results indicate that Nal1 affects polar auxin transport as well as the vascular patterns of rice plants and plays an important role in the control of lateral leaf growth.
PNAS-2013-Fujita-1310790110.pdf	NAL1 allele from a rice landrace greatly increases yield in modern indica cultivars	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Plant Breeding, Genetics, and Biotechnology, International Rice Research Institute, Metro Manila, Philippines.	Increasing crop production is essential for securing the future food supply in developing countries in Asia and Africa as economies and populations grow. However, although the Green Revolution led to increased grain production in the 1960s, no major advances have been made in increasing yield potential in rice since then. In this study, we identified a gene, SPIKELET NUMBER (SPIKE), from a tropical japonica rice landrace that enhances the grain productivity of indica cultivars through pleiotropic effects on plant architecture. Map-based cloning revealed that SPIKE was identical to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), which has been reported to control vein pattern in leaf. Phenotypic analyses of a near-isogenic line of a popular indica cultivar, IR64, and overexpressor lines revealed increases in spikelet number, leaf size, root system, and the number of vascular bundles, indicating the enhancement of source size and translocation capacity as well as sink size. The near-isogenic line achieved 13-36% yield increase without any negative effect on grain appearance. Expression analysis revealed that the gene was expressed in all cell types: panicles, leaves, roots, and culms supporting the pleiotropic effects on plant architecture. Furthermore, SPIKE increased grain yield by 18% in the recently released indica cultivar IRRI146, and increased spikelet number in the genetic background of other popular indica cultivars. The use of SPIKE in rice breeding could contribute to food security in indica-growing regions such as South and Southeast Asia.
NA	Characterization of a Null Allelic Mutant of the Rice NAL1 Gene Reveals Its Role in Regulating Cell Division.	2015	PLoS One	College of Life Sciences, Qingdao Agricultural University, Qingdao, China; National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	Leaf morphology is closely associated with cell division. In rice, mutations in Narrow leaf 1 (NAL1) show narrow leaf phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that NAL1 plays a role in regulating vein patterning and increasing grain yield in indica cultivars, but its role in leaf growth and development remains unknown. In this report, we characterized two allelic mutants of NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1), nal1-2 and nal1-3, both of which showed a 50% reduction in leaf width and length, as well as a dwarf culm. Longitudinal and transverse histological analyses of leaves and internodes revealed that cell division was suppressed in the anticlinal orientation but enhanced in the periclinal orientation in the mutants, while cell size remained unaltered. In addition to defects in cell proliferation, the mutants showed abnormal midrib in leaves. Map-based cloning revealed that nal1-2 is a null allelic mutant of NAL1 since both the whole promoter and a 404-bp fragment in the first exon of NAL1 were deleted, and that a 6-bp fragment was deleted in the mutant nal1-3. We demonstrated that NAL1 functions in the regulation of cell division as early as during leaf primordia initiation. The altered transcript level of G1- and S-phase-specific genes suggested that NAL1 affects cell cycle regulation. Heterogenous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that NAL1 affects cell division. These results suggest that NAL1 controls leaf width and plant height through its effects on cell division.
NA	Natural Variation in the Flag Leaf Morphology of Rice Due to a Mutation of the NARROW LEAF 1 Gene in Oryza sativa L.	2015	Genetics	National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences; fstagu@affrc.go.jp.	We investigated the natural variations in the flag leaf morphology of rice. We conducted a principal component analysis based on nine flag leaf morphology traits using 103 accessions from the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences Core Collection. The first component explained 39% of total variance and the variable with highest loading was the width of the flag leaf (WFL). A genome-wide association analysis of 102 diverse Japanese accessions revealed that marker RM6992 on chromosome 4 was highly associated with WFL. In analyses of progenies derived from a cross between Takanari and Akenohoshi, the most significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for WFL was in a 10.3 kb-region containing the NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1) gene, located 0.4 Mb downstream of RM6992. Analyses of chromosomal segment substitution lines indicated that a mutation (G1509A single nucleotide mutation, causing an R233H amino acid substitution in NAL1) was present at the QTL. This explained 13% and 20% of total variability in WFL and the distance between small vascular bundles, respectively. The mutation apparently occurred during rice domestication and spread into japonica, tropical japonica, and indica subgroups. Notably, one accession, Phulba, had a NAL1 allele encoding only the N-terminal, or one-fourth, of the wild-type peptide. Given that the Phulba allele and the histidine-type allele showed essentially the same phenotype, the histidine-type allele was regarded as malfunctional. The phenotypes of transgenic plants varied depending on the ratio of histidine-type alleles to arginine-type alleles, raising the possibility that H(233)-type products function differently from and compete with R(233)-type products.
NA	Partial loss-of-function of NAL1 alters canopy photosynthesis by changing the contribution of upper and lower canopy leaves in rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Graduate School of Life Sciences, Toyo University, 1-1-1 Izumino, Itakura, Oura, Gunma, 374-0193, Japan.	Little is known about the genetic basis of leaf and canopy photosynthesis. Here we aimed to detect novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling photosynthesis by increasing leaf nitrogen content (LNC) per leaf area and analysed its effect on leaf and canopy photosynthesis. To identify QTL that increase photosynthetic rate in leaves, we screened chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivar Koshihikari and O. sativa ssp. indica cultivar Nona Bokra using LNC per leaf area as the phenotype indicator. Locus leaf nitrogen content on chromosome four (qLNC4) is associated with increased LNC and photosynthetic rate per leaf area. Moreover, a non-synonymous amino acid substitution was identified in the NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1) gene located in the qLNC4 region. This NAL1 allele increases LNC and photosynthetic rate per leaf area in flag leaves but does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis. This NAL1 allele also increases light capture and whole-leaf nitrogen content of the lower leaves and is associated with slower senescence in flag leaves. These results suggest that this NAL1 allele does not increase whole-leaf photosynthesis but plays a role in regulating spatial and temporal trade-offs among traits at the whole-plant level.
NA	Narrow leaf 1 (NAL1) regulates leaf shape by affecting cell expansion in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	The Key Laboratory of Oasis Eco-agriculture, Xinjiang Production and Construction Group, Shihezi University, Shihezi, Xinjiang, 832003, China.	The narrow leaf1 (nal1) mutant of rice (Oryza sativa L.) exhibits a narrow leaf phenotype. Previous studies have shown that NAL1 modulates leaf size by affecting vein patterning and cell division; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that the nal1 mutant shows reduced size of the leaf abaxial epidermal cells and culm parenchyma cells compared with the wild type (WT), indicating that NAL1 also regulates cell expansion. To understand the molecular mechanism of the reduced cell size phenotype, leaves of 40-day-old nal1 mutant and WT seedlings were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis, which has identified 4277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and the nal1 mutant. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed a large number of genes down-regulated in the nal1 mutant were involved in cell wall formation. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that NAL1-regulated DEGs, such as ARFs and SAURs, were mapped in auxin signal transduction and auxin-regulated cell expansion pathways. A combination of RNA-Seq analysis and gene expression validation using RT-qPCR suggested that NAL1 is involved in the regulation of auxin-mediated acid growth in rice. These results indicate that, in addition to controlling cell division, NAL1 controls leaf width, at least partially, through its effect on cell expansion, probably via the acid growth mechanism.
NA	Natural Sequence Variations and Combinations of GNP1 and NAL1 Determine the Grain Number per Panicle in Rice.	2020	Rice (N Y)	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang, 110866, Liaoning, China.	The grain number per panicle (GNP), which is one of three grain yield components, is an important trait for the genetic improvement of rice. Although the NAL1 and GNP1 genes regulating the rice GNP and grain yield have been cloned, their allelic diversity, functional differences in rice germplasms, and effects of their combination on GNP and grain yield remain unclear.Based on DNA sequences of these two genes in 198 cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) and 8-10 wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) germplasms, 16 and 14 haplotypes were identified for NAL1 and GNP1, respectively. The NAL1 gene had the strongest effects on GNP in indica (xian) and japonica (geng) subpopulations. In contrast, GNP1 had no significant effects in the geng subpopulation and was rare in the xian background, in which the superior GNP1 allele (GNP1-6) was detected in only 4.0% of the 198 germplasms. Compared with the transgenic lines with GNP1 or NAL1, the transgenic lines with both genes had a higher GNP (15.5%-25.4% and 11.6%-15.9% higher, respectively) and grain yield (5.7%-9.0% and 8.3%-12.3% higher, respectively) across 3<U+2009>years. The two genes combined in the introgression lines in Lemont background resulted in especially favorable effects on the GNP.Our results indicated that the GNP1 and NAL1 exhibited obvious differentiation and their combinations can significantly increase the grain yield in geng rice cultivars. These observations provide insights into the molecular basis of the GNP and may be useful for rice breeding of high yield potential by pyramiding GNP1 and NAL1.
NA	A Novel Mutation of the NARROW LEAF 1 Gene Adversely Affects Plant Architecture in Rice ( Oryza sativa L.)	2020	Int J Mol Sci	School of Plant, Environmental, and Soil Sciences, Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA.	Plant architecture is critical for enhancing the adaptability and productivity of crop plants. Mutants with an altered plant architecture allow researchers to elucidate the genetic network and the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we characterized a novel nal1 rice mutant with short height, small panicle, and narrow and thick deep green leaves that was identified from a cross between a rice cultivar and a weedy rice accession. Bulked segregant analysis coupled with genome re-sequencing and cosegregation analysis revealed that the overall mutant phenotype was caused by a 1395-bp deletion spanning over the last two exons including the transcriptional end site of the nal1 gene. This deletion resulted in chimeric transcripts involving nal1 and the adjacent gene, which were validated by a reference-guided assembly of transcripts followed by PCR amplification. A comparative transcriptome analysis of the mutant and the wild-type rice revealed 263 differentially expressed genes involved in cell division, cell expansion, photosynthesis, reproduction, and gibberellin (GA) and brassinosteroids (BR) signaling pathways, suggesting the important regulatory role of nal1. Our study indicated that nal1 controls plant architecture through the regulation of genes involved in the photosynthetic apparatus, cell cycle, and GA and BR signaling pathways.
NA	Characterization of dwarf and narrow leaf ( dnl-4) mutant in rice	2020	Plant Signal Behav	College of Life Science and Natural Resources, Dong-A University , Busan, Korea.	Height and leaf morphology are important agronomic traits of the major crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). In previous studies, the dwarf and narrow leaf genes (dnl1, dnl2 and dnl3) have identified in rice. Using the Ac/Ds knockout system, we found a new dwarf and narrow leaf (dnl) mutant and identified mutated gene. The dnl-4 mutant showed reduced plant height and leaf blade width compared to the wild type, and increased leaf inclination. The morphological defects of the mutant were caused by the suppressed expression of the DNL-4 gene, which encodes a pfkB carbohydrate kinase protein. These results suggest that DNL-4 expression is involved in modulating plant height and leaf growth. Furthermore, DNL-4 expression also affects productivity in rice: the dnl-4 mutant exhibited reduced panicle length and grain width compared with the wild type. To understand DNL-4 function in rice, we analyzed the expression levels of leaf growth-related genes, such as NAL1, NAL7, and CSLD4, in the dnl-4 mutant. Expression of NAL1 and NAL7 was downregulated in the dnl-4 mutant compared to the wild type. The observation that DNL-4 expression corresponded with that of NAL1 and NAL7 is consistent with the narrow leaf phenotype of the dnl-4 mutant. These results suggest that DNL-4 regulates plant height and leaf structure in rice.
NA	Partially functional NARROW LEAF1 balances leaf photosynthesis and plant architecture for greater rice yield.	2022	Plant Physiol	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center (HHRRC), Changsha 410125, China.	NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1) is an elite gene in rice (Oryza sativa), given its close connection to leaf photosynthesis, hybrid vigor, and yield-related agronomic traits; however, the underlying mechanism by which this gene affects these traits remains elusive. In this study, we systematically measured leaf photosynthetic parameters, leaf anatomical parameters, architectural parameters, and agronomic traits in indica cultivar 9311, in 9311 with the native NAL1 replaced by the Nipponbare NAL1 (9311-NIL), and in 9311 with the NAL1 fully mutated (9311-nal1). Leaf length, width, and spikelet number gradually increased from lowest to highest in 9311-nal1, 9311, and 9311-NIL. In contrast, the leaf photosynthetic rate on a leaf area basis, leaf thickness, and panicle number gradually decreased from highest to lowest in 9311-nal1, 9311, and 9311-NIL. RNA-seq analysis showed that NAL1 negatively regulates the expression of photosynthesis-related genes; NAL1 also influenced expression of many genes related to phytohormone signaling, as also shown by different leaf contents of 3-Indoleacetic acid, jasmonic acid, Gibberellin A3, and isopentenyladenine among these genotypes. Furthermore, field experiments with different planting densities showed that 9311 had a larger biomass and yield advantage under low planting density compared to either 9311-NIL or 9311-nall. This study shows both direct and indirect effects of NAL1 on leaf photosynthesis; furthermore, we show that a partially functional NAL1 allele helps maintain a balanced leaf photosynthesis and plant architecture for increased biomass and grain yield in the field.
NA	Large Vascular Bundle Phloem Area 4 enhances grain yield and quality in rice via source-sink-flow.	2022	Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, Shenyang 110866, China.	In rice (Oryza sativa L.), vascular bundle phloem tissue in the panicle neck is vital for the transport of photosynthetic products from leaf to panicle and is positively associated with grain yield. However, genetic regulation of the single large vascular bundle phloem area (LVPA) in rice panicle neck tissue remains poorly understood. In this study, we carried out genome-wide association analysis of LVPA in the panicle neck using 386 rice accessions and isolated and characterized the gene LVPA4, which is allelic to NARROW LEAF1 (NAL1). Phenotypic analyses were carried out on the near-isogenic line (NIL) NIL-LVPA4LT in the high-yielding indica (xian) cultivar Teqing and on overexpression lines transformed with a vector carrying the Lemont alleles of LVPA4. Both NIL-LVPA4LT and LVPA4 overexpression lines exhibited significantly increased LVPA, enlarged flag leaf size, and improved panicle type. NIL-LVPA4LT had a 7.6%-9.6% yield increase, mainly due to the significantly higher filled grain number per panicle, larger vascular system for transporting photoassimilates to spikelets, and more sufficient source supply that could service the increased sink capacity. Moreover, NIL-LVPA4LT had improved grain quality compared with Teqing, which was mainly attributed to substantial improvement in grain filling, especially for inferior spikelets in NIL-LVPA4LT. The single-nucleotide variation in the third exon of LVPA4 was associated with LVPA, spikelet number, and leaf size throughout sequencing analysis in 386 panels. The results demonstrate that LVPA4 has synergistic effects on source capacity, sink size, and flow transport and plays crucial roles in rice productivity and grain quality, thus revealing the value of LVPA4 in rice breeding programs for improved varieties.
NA	Serine protease NAL1 exerts pleiotropic functions through degradation of TOPLESS-related corepressor in rice.	2023	Nat Plants	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	NARROW LEAF 1 (NAL1) is a breeding-valuable pleiotropic gene that affects multiple agronomic traits in rice, although the molecular mechanism is largely unclear. Here, we report that NAL1 is a serine protease and displays a novel hexameric structure consisting of two ATP-mediated doughnut-shaped trimeric complexes. Moreover, we identified TOPLESS-related corepressor OsTPR2 involved in multiple growth and development processes as the substrate of NAL1. We found that NAL1 degraded OsTPR2, thus modulating the expression of downstream genes related to hormone signalling pathways, eventually achieving its pleiotropic physiological function. An elite allele, NAL1(A), which may have originated from wild rice, could increase grain yield. Furthermore, the NAL1 homologues in different crops have a similar pleiotropic function to NAL1. Our study uncovers a NAL1-OsTPR2 regulatory module and provides gene resources for the design of high-yield crops.
