Symbol	Expression
NAL1|qFLW4	 Heterogenous expression of NAL1 in fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) further supported that NAL1 affects cell division
NAL1|qFLW4	 A combination of RNA-Seq analysis and gene expression validation using RT-qPCR suggested that NAL1 is involved in the regulation of auxin-mediated acid growth in rice
