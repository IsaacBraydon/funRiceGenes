NF-YC12|OsNF-YC12	grain quality	NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	NF-YC12 and bHLH144 maintain NF-YB1 stability from the degradation mediated by ubiquitin/26S proteasome, while NF-YB1 directly binds to the 'G-box' domain of Wx promoter and activates Wx transcription, hence to regulate rice grain quality.
