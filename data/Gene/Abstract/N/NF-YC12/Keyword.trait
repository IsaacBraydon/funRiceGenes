NF-YC12|OsNF-YC12	grain quality	NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
NF-YC12|OsNF-YC12	grain quality	NF-YB1-YC12-bHLH144 complex directly activates Wx to regulate grain quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	NF-YC12 and bHLH144 maintain NF-YB1 stability from the degradation mediated by ubiquitin/26S proteasome, while NF-YB1 directly binds to the 'G-box' domain of Wx promoter and activates Wx transcription, hence to regulate rice grain quality.
NF-YC12|OsNF-YC12	grain weight	NF-YC12 is a key multi-functional regulator of accumulation of seed storage substances in rice.	Knockout of NF-YC12 significantly decreased grain weight as well as altering starch and protein accumulation and starch granule formation.
NF-YC12|OsNF-YC12	endosperm development	NF-YC12 is a key multi-functional regulator of accumulation of seed storage substances in rice.	This study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving NF-YC12, which coordinates multiple pathways to regulate endosperm development and the accumulation of storage substances in rice seeds.
