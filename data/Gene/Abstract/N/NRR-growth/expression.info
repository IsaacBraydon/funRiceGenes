NRR|CRCT	 The expression of CRCT showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose |  Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression |  The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and Î±-glucan phospholylase were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of CRCT |  Given these observations, we suggest that CRCT is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates	 Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression	 Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression
