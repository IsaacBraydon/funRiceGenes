NRR|CRCT	 The expression of CRCT showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose |  Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression |  The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and Î±-glucan phospholylase were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of CRCT |  Given these observations, we suggest that CRCT is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates	 Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression	 Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression
NRR|CRCT	 In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in leaf blade using CRCT overexpression and RNAi knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions |  In leaf sheath, the starch content was markedly changed in relation to CRCT expression levels under both CO2 conditions |  The overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT did not cause large effects on the photosynthetic rate of the transgenic lines grown under ambient CO2 condition	 In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in leaf blade using CRCT overexpression and RNAi knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions |  The overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT did not cause large effects on the photosynthetic rate of the transgenic lines grown under ambient CO2 condition	 In this study, we analyzed the effects of the starch level in the leaf sheath on the photosynthetic rate in leaf blade using CRCT overexpression and RNAi knockdown transgenic rice grown under ambient (38 Pa) or elevated (100 Pa) CO2 conditions |  The overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT did not cause large effects on the photosynthetic rate of the transgenic lines grown under ambient CO2 condition
