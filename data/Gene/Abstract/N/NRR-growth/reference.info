To better understand the response of rice to nutrient stress, we have taken a systematic approach to identify rice genes that respond to deficiency of macronutrients and affect rice growth. We report here the expression and biological functions of a previously uncharacterized rice gene that we have named NRR (nutrition response and root growth). NRR is alternatively spliced, producing two 5'-coterminal transcripts, NRRa and NRRb, encoding two proteins of 308 and 223 aa, respectively. Compared to NRRb, NRRa possesses an additional CCT domain at the C-terminus. Expression of NRR in rice seedling roots was significantly influenced by deficiency of macronutrients. Knock-down of expression of NRRa or NRRb by RNA interference resulted in enhanced rice root growth. By contrast, overexpression of NRRa in rice exhibited significantly retarded root growth. These results revealed that both NRRa and NRRb played negative regulatory roles in rice root growth. Our findings suggest that NRRa and NRRb, acting as the key components, modulate the rice root architecture with the availability of macronutrients.
NA	CO2 Responsive CCT protein, CRCT Is a Positive Regulator of Starch Synthesis in Vegetative Organs of Rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Kobe University fukayama@people.kobe-u.ac.jp.	A novel CO2 Responsive protein (CRCT) containing a CONSTANS, CONSTANS-like and TOC1 (CCT) domain but not Zinc finger motif is described which is up-regulated under elevated CO2 in rice (Oryza sativa). The expression of CRCT showed diurnal oscillation peaked at the end of light period and was also increased by sugars such as glucose and sucrose. Promoter GUS analysis showed that CRCT was highly expressed in the phloem of various tissues such as leaf blade and leaf sheath. Overexpression or RNAi knockdown of CRCT had no appreciable effect on plant growth and photosynthesis except that tiller angle was significantly increased by the overexpression. More importantly, starch content in leaf sheath which serves as a temporary storage organ for photoassimilates, was markedly increased in overexpression lines and decreased in knockdown lines. The expressions of several genes related to starch synthesis such as ADP-glucose pyrophospholylase and Î±-glucan phospholylase were significantly changed in transgenic lines and positively correlated with the expression levels of CRCT. Given these observations, we suggest that CRCT is a positive regulator of starch accumulation in vegetative tissues, regulating coordinated expression of starch synthesis genes in response to the levels of photoassimilates.
