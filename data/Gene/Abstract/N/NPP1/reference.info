Nanjo-2006-Rice plastidial N-gl.pdf	Rice plastidial N-glycosylated nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase is transported from the ER-golgi to the chloroplast through the secretory pathway	2006	Plant Cell	Laboratory of Plant and Microbial Genome Control, Department of Applied Biological Chemistry, Niigata University, Niigata 950-2181, Japan.	A nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) activity that catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of ADP-glucose (ADPG) has been shown to occur in the plastidial compartment of both mono- and dicotyledonous plants. To learn more about this enzyme, we purified two NPPs from rice (Oryza sativa) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedlings. Both enzymes are glycosylated, since they bind to concanavalin A, stain with periodic acid-Schiff reagent, and are digested by Endo-H. A complete rice NPP cDNA, designated as NPP1, was isolated, characterized, and overexpressed in transgenic plants displaying high ADPG hydrolytic activity. Databank searches revealed that NPP1 belongs to a functionally divergent group of plant nucleotide hydrolases. NPP1 contains numerous N-glycosylation sites and a cleavable hydrophobic signal sequence that does not match with the N-terminal part of the mature protein. Both immunocytochemical analyses and confocal fluorescence microscopy of rice cells expressing NPP1 fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) revealed that NPP1-GFP occurs in the plastidial compartment. Brefeldin A treatment of NPP1-GFP-expressing cells prevented NPP1-GFP accumulation in the chloroplasts. Endo-H digestibility studies revealed that both NPP1 and NPP1-GFP in the chloroplast are glycosylated. Collectively, these data demonstrate the trafficking of glycosylated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi system to the chloroplast in higher plants.
Zhang-2011-Identification of ri.pdf	Identification of rice purple acid phosphatases related to phosphate starvation signalling	2011	Plant Biol (Stuttg)	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Purple acid phosphatases (PAPs) are a family of metallo-phosphoesterases involved in a variety of physiological functions, especially phosphate deficiency adaptations in plants. We identified 26 putative PAP genes by a genome-wide analysis of rice (Oryza sativa), 24 of which have isolated EST sequences in the dbEST database. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that 25 of these genes possess sets of metal-ligating residues typical of known PAPs. Phylogenetic analysis classified the 26 rice and 29 Arabidopsis PAPs into three main groups and seven subgroups. We detected transcripts of 21 PAP genes in roots or leaves of rice seedlings. The expression levels of ten PAP genes were up-regulated by both phosphate deprivation and over-expression of the transcription factor OsPHR2. These PAP genes all contained one or two OsPHR2 binding elements in their promoter regions, implying that they are directly regulated by OsPHR2. Both acid phosphatase (AP) and surface secretory acid phosphatase (SAP) activity assays showed that the up-regulation of PAPs by Pi starvation, OsPHR2 over-expression, PHO2 knockout or OsSPX1 RNA interference led to an increase in AP and SAP activity in rice roots. This study reveals the potential for developing technologies for crop improvement in phosphorus use efficiency.
