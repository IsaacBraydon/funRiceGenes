NA	A null allele of the pol IV second subunit impacts stature and reproductive development in Oryza sativa.	2022	Plant J	School of Plant Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, 85721, USA.	All eukaryotes possess three DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, Pols I-III, while land plants possess two additional polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V. Derived through duplication of Pol II subunits, Pol IV produces 24-nt short interfering RNAs that interact with Pol V transcripts to target de novo DNA methylation and silence transcription of transposons. Members of the grass family encode additional duplicated subunits of Pol IV and V, raising questions regarding the function of each paralog. In this study, we identify a null allele of the putative Pol IV second subunit, NRPD2, and demonstrate that NRPD2 is the sole subunit functioning with NRPD1 in small RNA production and CHH methylation in leaves. Homozygous nrpd2 mutants have neither gametophytic defects nor embryo lethality, although adult plants are dwarf and sterile.
