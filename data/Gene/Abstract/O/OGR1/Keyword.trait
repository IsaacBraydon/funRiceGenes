OGR1	growth	Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria	 This mutation, named opaque and growth retardation 1 (ogr1), was generated by T-DNA insertion into a gene that encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein containing the DYW motif| We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development
OGR1	mitochondria	Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria	 The OGR1-sGFP fusion protein is localized to mitochondria| We conclude that OGR1 is essential for RNA editing in rice mitochondria and is required for normal growth and development|Rice OGR1 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat-DYW protein and is essential for RNA editing in mitochondria
