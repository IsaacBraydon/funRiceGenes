Sakakibara-1996-Isolation and charac.pdf	Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase isoforms from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	1996	Plant Mol Biol	Molecular Function Laboratory, National Food Research Institute, 2-1-2 Kannondai, 305, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan	The vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) is an electrogenic H+ pump, which was found in the plant vacuolar membrane. Two cDNA clones (OVP1 and OVP2) encoding the V-PPase were isolated from cultured rice (Oryza sativa L.) cells and subsequently sequenced. The sequence analysis has revealed thatOVP1 contains 2316 nucleotides of open reading frame (ORF) and 362 nucleotides of the 3â€‘ù<U+3E32>-untranslated region, whereasOVP2 comprises 2304 nucleotides of ORF and 312 nucleotides of the 3â€‘ù<U+3E32>-untranslated region. The nucleotide sequences of ORF ofOVP1 andOVP2 are 80.7% identical, and their 5â€‘ù<U+3E32>- and 3â€‘ù<U+3E32>-untranslated regions have 39.4% and 48.4% identity, respectively. The polypeptides encoded by the ORF ofOVP1 andOVP2 contain 771 and 767 amino acids, respectively, and the sequences of the OVP proteins are very similar to those of other V-PPases, which are shown to have 85â€<U+393C><U+3E33>91% homology. Chromosomal mapping by RFLP techniques demonstrates that OVP1 and OVP2 are isoforms encoded by different genes. BothOVP1 andOVP2 are mapped on the same chromosome (chromosome 6) to a distance of ca. 90 cM. Northern analysis indicates that theOVP1 andOVP2 are also expressed in intact rice plants andOVP2 shows higher expression in the calli than the roots and shoots, compared toOVP1. These results show that at least two genes encoding the V-PPases are present in rice genome and their expressions are probably regulated in a different manner.
