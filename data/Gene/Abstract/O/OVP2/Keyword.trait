OVP2	shoot	Isolation and characterization of cDNAs encoding vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase isoforms from rice (Oryza sativa L.)	 Northern analysis indicates that theOVP1 andOVP2 are also expressed in intact rice plants andOVP2 shows higher expression in the calli than the roots and shoots, compared toOVP1
