Rab proteins play an essential role in regulating vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells. Previously, we characterized OsRab11, which in concert with OsGAP1 and OsGDI3 regulates vesicular trafficking from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane or vacuole. To further elucidate the physiological function of OsRab11 in plants, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens using OsRab11 as bait. OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11. A co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed this interaction. The green fluorescent protein-OsOPR8 fusion product was targeted to the cytoplasm and peroxisomes of protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana. OsOPR8 exhibited NADPH-dependent reduction activity when 2-cyclohexen-1-one (CyHE) and 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) were supplied as possible substrates. Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included. OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments. Overexpressed OsRab11 transgenic plants showed resistance to pathogens through induced expression of JA-responsive genes. In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8.
Li-2011-Comparative characte.pdf	Comparative characterization, expression pattern and function analysis of the 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase gene family in rice	2011	Plant Cell Rep	State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol and Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of Ministry of Education, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, People's Republic of China.	The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) belong to the old yellow enzyme family of flavoenzymes and form multiple subfamilies in angiosperm plants. In our previous study, a comparative genomic analysis showed that five OPR subfamilies (subs. I-V) occur in monocots, and two subfamilies (subs. I and II) in dicots. Here, a comparative study of five OsOPR genes, representing five subfamilies (I-V) in rice, was performed to provide insights into OPR biochemical properties and physiological importance. Comparative analysis of the three-dimensional structure by homology modeling indicated all five OsOPR proteins contained a highly conserved backbone with (alpha/beta)(8)-barrels, while two middle variable regions (MVR i and ii) were also detected and defined. Analysis of enzymatic characteristics revealed that all five OsOPR fusion proteins exhibit distinct substrate specificity. Different catalytic activity was observed using racemic OPDA and trans-2-hexen-1-al as substrates, suggesting OsOPR family genes participate in two main branches of the octadecanoid pathway, including the allene oxide synthase and hydroperoxide lyase pathways which regulate various developmental processes and/or defense responses. The transcript profiles of five OsOPR genes exhibited strong tissue-specific and inducible expression patterns under abiotic stress, hormones and plant wounding treatments. Furthermore, the transcriptions of OsOPR04-1 (OsOPR11) and OsOPR08-1 (OsOPR7), representing subs. I and II, respectively, were observed in all six selected tissues and with all above-stress treatments. This suggests that these two subfamilies play an important role during different developmental stages and in response to stresses; while the expressions of OsOPR06-1 (OsOPR6), OsOPR01-1 (OsOPR10) and OsOPR02-1 (OsOPR8), representing subs. III, IV and V respectively, were strongly up-regulated with abscisic acid (ABA) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) treatments in roots, suggesting these three subfamilies play an important role in responding to hormones especially ABA and IAA signals in roots.
Tani-2008-Identification of th.pdf	Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice	2007	Planta	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Enzyme 12-oxophytodienoate (OPDA) reductase (EC1.3.1.42), which is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), catalyses the reduction of 10, 11-double bonds of OPDA to yield 3-oxo-2-(2'-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid (OPC-8:0). The rice OsOPR1 gene encodes OPDA reductase (OPR) converting (-)-cis-OPDA preferentially, rather than (+)-cis-OPDA, a natural precursor of JA. Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis. Recombinant OsOPR7-His protein efficiently catalysed the reduction of both enantiomers of cis-OPDA, similar to the OPR3 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The expression of OsOPR7 mRNA was induced and reached maximum levels within 0.5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression. The GFP-OsOPR7 fusion protein was detected exclusively in peroxisomes in onion epidermal cells. Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene. We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice.
