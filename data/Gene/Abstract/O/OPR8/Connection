OPR8	OsRab11	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling	 OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11| Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included| OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments| In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8
