OPR8	OsRab11	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling	 OsOPR8 was isolated and shown to interact with OsRab11
OPR8	OsRab11	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling	 Interestingly, NADPH oxidation by OsOPR8 was increased when wild-type OsRab11 or the constitutively active form of OsRab11 (Q78L) were included in the reaction mix, but not when the dominant negative form of OsRab11 (S28N) was included
OPR8	OsRab11	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling	 OsRab11 was expressed broadly in plants and both OsRab11 and OsOPR8 were induced by jasmonic acid (JA) and elicitor treatments
OPR8	OsRab11	Rice Rab11 is required for JA-mediated defense signaling	 In conclusion, OsRab11 may be required for JA-mediated defense signaling by activating the reducing activity of OsOPR8
