ONAC063	salinity	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	 ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots
ONAC063	salinity	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure
ONAC063	salinity	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	Microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed upregulated expression of some salinity-inducible genes, including the amylase gene AMY1, in ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis
ONAC063	salinity	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	Thus, ONAC063 may play an important role in eliciting responses to high-salinity stress
ONAC063	seed	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	The seeds of ONAC063-expressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed enhanced tolerance to high-salinity and osmotic pressure
ONAC063	salt	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis
ONAC063	transcription factor	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	The rice cDNA inserted in R08946 encoded a NAC transcription factor, ONAC063
ONAC063	salinity stress	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	 Thus, ONAC063 may play an important role in eliciting responses to high-salinity stress
ONAC063	temperature	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots
ONAC063	root	Tolerance to various environmental stresses conferred by the salt-responsive rice gene ONAC063 in transgenic Arabidopsis	ONAC063 expression was not induced by high-temperature but highly induced by high-salinity in rice roots
