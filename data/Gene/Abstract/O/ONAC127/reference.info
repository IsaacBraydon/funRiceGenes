NA	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	2016	Front Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome Research New Delhi, India.	NACs are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) involved in multiple aspects of development and stress. In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels. They exhibit significantly strong association with seed size/weight with the sequence variations located in the upstream regulatory region. Concomitantly, their expression pattern/levels during seed development vary amongst different accessions with variation in seed size. The alterations in the promoter sequences of the three genes, amongst the five rice accessions, correlate with the expression levels to a certain extent only. In terms of transcriptional properties, the three NAC TFs can activate and/or suppress downstream genes, though to different extents. Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively. Interestingly, these two proteins interact with ONAC026 and the dimers localize in the nucleus. Trans-splicing between ONAC020 and ONAC026 results in three additional forms of ONAC020. The transcriptional properties including activation, repression, subcellular localization and heterodimerization of trans-spliced forms of ONAC020 and ONAC026 are different, indicating toward their role as competitors. The analysis presented in this paper helps to conclude that the three NAC genes, which are associated with seed size, have independent as well as overlapping roles during the process and can be exploited as potential targets for crop improvement.
NA	A Heat Stress Responsive NAC Transcription Factor Heterodimer Plays Key Roles in Rice Grain Filling	2021	J Exp Bot	College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China.	High temperature often leads to the failure of grain filling in rice (Oryza sativa) to cause yield loss, while the mechanism is not well elucidated yet. Here, we report that two seed-specific NAM/ATAF/CUC domain transcription factors, ONAC127 and ONAC129, are responsive to heat stress and involved in the grain filling process of rice. ONAC127 and ONAC129 are dominantly expressed in the pericarp and can form a heterodimer during rice grain filling. CRISPR/Cas9 induced mutants and overexpression lines were then generated to investigate the functions of these two transcription factors. Interestingly, both knock-out and overexpression plants showed incomplete grain filling and shrunken grains, which became more severe under heat stress. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ONAC127 and ONAC129 mainly regulate stimulus response and nutrient transport. ChIP-seq analysis identified that the direct targets of ONAC127 and ONAC129 in developing rice seeds include monosaccharide transporter OsMST6, sugar transporter OsSWEET4, calmodulin-like protein OsMSR2 and AP2/ERF factor OsEATB. These results suggest that ONAC127 and ONAC129 may regulate grain filling through affecting sugar transportation and abiotic stress responses. Overall, this study demonstrates a transcriptional regulatory network involving ONAC127 and ONAC129 and coordinating multiple pathways to modulate seed development and heat stress response at rice reproductive stage.
