OM64	resistance	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 The om64 mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses
OM64	resistance	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 This study confirmed OM64 as a negative regulator  of rice herbivore resistance through regulating H2 O2 production
OM64	resistance	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 OM64 is a potentially efficient candidate to improve BPH and SSB resistance through gene deletion
OM64	mitochondria	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 Why the om64 mutant was resistant to both piercing-sucking and chewing  insects via a gene deficiency in mitochondria is discussed
OM64	tolerance	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 OM64 protein is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane by subcellular localization and its deficiency constitutively activated H2 O2 signaling, which stimulated antibiosis and tolerance to BPH
OM64	jasmonic	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 The om64 mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses
OM64	jasmonic acid	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 The om64 mutant also showed enhanced resistance to SSB, a chewing insect, which was due to promotion of Jasmonic acid biosynthesis and related responses
OM64	resistant	Deficiency of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Protein 64 Confers Rice Resistance to  Both Piercing-sucking and Chewing Insects in Rice.	 Why the om64 mutant was resistant to both piercing-sucking and chewing  insects via a gene deficiency in mitochondria is discussed
OM64	insect	Deficiency of mitochondrial outer membrane protein 64 confers rice resistance to both piercing-sucking and chewing insects in rice	Deficiency of mitochondrial outer membrane protein 64 confers rice resistance to both piercing©\sucking and chewing insects in rice
