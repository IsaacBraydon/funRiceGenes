DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Here, we identified Ovate Family Protein 1 (OFP1) as a DLT interacting protein
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Overexpression of OFP1 led to enlarged leaf angles, reduced plant height, and altered grain shape, largely resembled DLT overexpression plants
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Genetic analysis showed that the regulation of plant architecture by OFP1 depends on DLT function
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 Furthermore, we revealed that OFP1 directly interacts with GSK2 kinase, and inhibition of the kinase activity significantly promotes OFP1 protein accumulation in plant
OFP1	OsBZR1|BZR1	Brassinosteroids Regulate OFP1, a DLT Interacting Protein, to Modulate Plant Architecture and Grain Morphology in Rice.	 In addition, we found OFP1 was greatly induced by BR treatment, and OsBZR1, the critical transcription factor of BR signaling, was physically associated with the OFP1 promoter
OFP1	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
