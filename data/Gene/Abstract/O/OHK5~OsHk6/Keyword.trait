OsCKT1|OHK5|OsHk6	shoot	Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP	Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor
OsCKT1|OHK5|OsHk6	grain	Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP	OsHk4 and OsHk6 were highly expressed in spikelets, suggesting that tZ and iP might play key roles in grain development
OsCKT1|OHK5|OsHk6	cytokinin	Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP	OsHk6 was highly sensitive to isopentenyladenine (iP) and was capable of restoring cytokinin-dependent ARR6 reporter expression in the ahk2 ahk3 Arabidopsis mutant upon treatment with 1 nM iP
