1-s2.0-S0378111906003970-main.pdf	Identification and characterization of cytokinin-signalling gene families in rice	2006	Gene	Plant Genetics Laboratory, National Institute of Genetics, 1111 Yata, Mishima, Shizuoka-ken 411-8540, Japan.	We identified four histidine kinase (HK) genes of a cytokinin receptor family, two histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt) genes, thirteen A-type response regulator (RR) genes and six B-type RR genes in the rice genome. The HK genes (OHK2, OHK3, OHK4 and OHK5 for Oryza sativa HK), the HPt genes (OHP1 and OHP2 for O. sativa HPt) and the B-type RR genes (ORR1, ORR2, ORR3, ORR4 and ORR6 for O. sativa RR) except one (ORR5) showed expression in various organs. ORR5 was expressed in callus and flower. Three A-type RR genes (OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10 for O. sativa RR) showed cytokinin-induced expression, and three (OsRR8, OsRR12 and OsRR13) showed expression in flower. We also identified two other genes named OHK1 and CHARK (CHASE domain Receptor-like serine/threonine Kinase). OHK1 encodes an HK similar to Arabidopsis CKI1, which is involved in female gametophyte development. CHARK encodes a protein with an extracellular cytokinin-perceiving CHASE domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain which are connected with a single transmembrane domain. The presence of all four gene families and CHARK in the rice genome suggests that a cytokinin signal is transduced by the phosphotransfer mechanism as is the case in Arabidopsis, and that rice may have an additional novel signalling pathway involving serine/threonine phosphorylation.
Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Choi-1334-43.pdf	Functional identification of OsHk6 as a homotypic cytokinin receptor in rice with preferential affinity for iP	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences and Functional Genomics Center, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang 790-784, Korea.	Cytokinins are involved in key developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa), including the regulation of cell proliferation and grain yield. However, the in vivo action of histidine kinases (OsHks), putative cytokinin receptors, in rice cytokinin signaling remains elusive. This study examined the function and characteristics of OsHk3, 4 and 6 in rice. OsHk6 was highly sensitive to isopentenyladenine (iP) and was capable of restoring cytokinin-dependent ARR6 reporter expression in the ahk2 ahk3 Arabidopsis mutant upon treatment with 1 nM iP. OsHk4 recognized trans-zeatin (tZ) and iP, while OsHk3 scarcely induced cytokinin signaling activity. OsHk4 and OsHk6 mediated the canonical two-component signaling cascade of Arabidopsis to induce phosphorylation of ARR2. OsHk4 and OsHk6 were highly expressed in spikelets, suggesting that tZ and iP might play key roles in grain development. OsHk6 formed a self-interacting homomer in rice protoplasts, although the trans-phosphorylation activity between subunits was much lower than the intra-molecular trans-phosphorylation activity. This indicates that the action mechanism of OsHks is evolutionarily diverged from bacterial histidine kinases. Ectopic expression of OsHk6 in rice calli promoted green pigmentation and subsequent shoot induction, further supporting an OsHk6 in planta function as a cytokinin receptor. From the results of this study, OsHks are homomeric cytokinin receptors with distinctive cytokinin preferences in rice.
NA	Isolation, Characterization and Transcriptome Analysis of a Cytokinin Receptor Mutant Osckt1 in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	College of Science and Technology, Ningbo University Ningbo, China.	Cytokinins play important roles in regulating plant development, including shoot and root meristems, leaf longevity, and grain yield. However, the in planta functions of rice cytokinin receptors have not been genetically characterized yet. Here we isolated a rice mutant, Osckt1, with enhanced tolerance to cytokinin treatment. Further analysis showed that Osckt1 was insensitive to aromatic cytokinins but responded normally to isoprenoid and phenylurea-type cytokinins. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative cytokinin receptor gene, histidine kinase 6 (OsHK6). OsCKT1 was found to be expressed in various tissues throughout the plant and the protein was located in the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, whole-genome gene expression profiling analysis showed that OsCKT1 was involved in cytokinin regulation of a number of biological processes, including secondary metabolism, sucrose and starch metabolism, chlorophyll synthesis, and photosynthesis. Our results demonstrate that OsCKT1 plays important roles in cytokinin perception and control of root development in rice.
NA	The HK5 and HK6 cytokinin receptors mediate diverse developmental pathways in rice	2020	Development	Department of Biology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA.	The phytohormone cytokinin regulates diverse aspects of plant growth and development. Our understanding of the metabolism and perception of cytokinin has made great strides in recent years, mostly from studies of the model dicot Arabidopsis Here, we employed a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to disrupt a subset of cytokinin histidine kinase (HK) receptors in rice (Oryza sativa) in order to explore the role of cytokinin in a monocot species. In hk5 and hk6 single mutants, the root growth, leaf width, inflorescence architecture and/or floral development were affected. The double hk5 hk6 mutant showed more substantial defects, including severely reduced root and shoot growth, a smaller shoot apical meristem, and an enlarged root cap. Flowering was delayed in the hk5 hk6 mutant and the panicle was significantly reduced in size and infertile due to multiple defects in floral development. The hk5 hk6 mutant also exhibited a severely reduced cytokinin response, consistent with the developmental phenotypes arising from a defect in cytokinin signaling. These results indicate that HK5 and HK6 act as cytokinin receptors, with overlapping functions to regulate diverse aspects of rice growth and development.
