ONAC300	meristem	Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice	High levels of ONAC300 mRNA were detected by in situ hybridization in developing shoot apical meristem (SAM) and in the associated young leaves
ONAC300	culm	Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice	RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles
ONAC300	flower	Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice	Thus, ONAC300 is a novel member of the NAC family which is expressed at very early developmental stages in the shoot, root and flower, as well as in the mature phloem of vascular tissues in rice
ONAC300	panicle	Molecular characterization of ONAC300, a novel NAC gene specifically expressed at early stages in various developing tissues of rice	RT-PCR analysis further revealed that the levels of ONAC300 transcripts were higher in leaves, roots and culms than in panicles
