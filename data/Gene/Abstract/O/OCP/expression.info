OCP	 Many genes related to plant immunity were enriched in the ocp-ko1 line whose expression levels changed significantly |  The expression of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) biosynthesis and regulatory genes were up-regulated, while that of auxin efflux transporters was down-regulated in ocp-ko1 |  Therefore, OCP negatively regulates blast resistance in rice by interacting with OsRACK1A or OsSNAP32 and influencing the expression profiles of many resistance-related genes
