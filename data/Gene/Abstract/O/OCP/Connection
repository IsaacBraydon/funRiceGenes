OCP	OsRACK1A	Knockout of a papain-like cysteine protease gene OCP enhances blast resistance in rice.	 We prove that OCP, featuring cysteine protease activity, interacts with OsRACK1A (receptor for activated C kinase 1) and OsSNAP32 (synaptosome-associated protein of 32 kD) physically in vitro and in vivo, and they co-locate in the rice cytoplasm but cannot form a ternary complex
OCP	OsRACK1A	Knockout of a papain-like cysteine protease gene OCP enhances blast resistance in rice.	 Therefore, OCP negatively regulates blast resistance in rice by interacting with OsRACK1A or OsSNAP32 and influencing the expression profiles of many resistance-related genes
