OASA1	panicle	Characterization of rice anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit genes OASA1 and OASA2. Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1	OASA1 is expressed in all tissues tested, but the amount of its mRNA was greater in panicles than in leaves and roots
