OASA1	OASA2	Characterization of rice anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit genes OASA1 and OASA2. Tryptophan accumulation in transgenic rice expressing a feedback-insensitive mutant of OASA1	 Two genes, OASA1 and OASA2, encoding AS alpha-subunits were isolated from a monocotyledonous plant, rice (Oryza sativa cv Nipponbare), and were characterized| A phylogenetic tree of AS alpha-subunits from various species revealed a close evolutionary relationship among OASA1 and Arabidopsis ASA2, Ruta graveolens AS alpha 2, and tobacco ASA2, whereas OASA2, Arabidopsis ASA1, and R| The abundance of OASA2 transcripts is similar among tissues and greater than that of OASA1 transcripts; furthermore, OASA2 expression was induced by a chitin heptamer, a potent elicitor, suggesting that OASA2 participates in secondary metabolism| Expression of wild-type OASA1 or OASA2 transgenes did not affect the Trp content of rice calli or plants|Characterization of rice anthranilate synthase alpha-subunit genes OASA1 and OASA2.
