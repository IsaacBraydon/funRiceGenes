NA	Identification and fine mapping of qGR6.2, a novel locus controlling rice seed germination under salt stress	2021	BMC Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Modern Crop Production, Cyrus Tang Innovation Center for Crop Seed Industry, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Background: Rice growth is frequently affected by salinity. When exposed to high salinity, rice seed germination and seedling establishment are significantly inhibited. With the promotion of direct-seeding in Asia, improving rice seed germination under salt stress is crucial for breeding.  Results: In this study, an indica landrace Wujiaozhan (WJZ) was identified with high germinability under salt stress. A BC1F2 population derived from the crossing WJZ/Nip (japonica, Nipponbare)//Nip, was used to quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for the seed germination rate (GR) and germination index (GI) under H2O and 300 mM NaCl conditions. A total of 13 QTLs were identified, i.e. ten QTLs under H2O conditions and nine QTLs under salt conditions. Six QTLs, qGR6.1, qGR8.1, qGR8.2, qGR10.1, qGR10.2 and qGI10.1 were simultaneously identified under two conditions. Under salt conditions, three QTLs, qGR6.2, qGR10.1 and qGR10.2 for GR were identified at different time points during seed germination, which shared the same chromosomal region with qGI6.2, qGI10.1 and qGI10.2 for GI respectively. The qGR6.2 accounted for more than 20% of phenotypic variation under salt stress, as the major effective QTL. Furthermore, qGR6.2 was verified via the BC2F2 population and narrowed to a 65.9-kb region with eleven candidate genes predicted. Based on the microarray database, five candidate genes were found with high transcript abundances at the seed germination stage, of which LOC_Os06g10650 and LOC_Os06g10710 were differentially expressed after seed imbibition. RT-qPCR results showed the expression of LOC_Os06g10650 was significantly up-regulated in two parents with higher levels in WJZ than Nip during seed germination under salt conditions. Taken together, it suggests that LOC_Os06g10650, encoding tyrosine phosphatase family protein, might be the causal candidate gene for qGR6.2.  Conclusions: In this study, we identified 13 QTLs from a landrace WJZ that confer seed germination traits under H2O and salt conditions. A major salt-tolerance-specific QTL qGR6.2 was fine mapped to a 65.9-kb region. Our results provide information on the genetic basis of improving rice seed germination under salt stress by marker-assisted selection (MAS).
NA	Genetic Analysis of S5-Interacting Genes Regulating Hybrid Sterility in Rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources, College of Life Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, 530004, China.	Background: Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) comprises two subspecies, O. sativa subsp. indica and subsp. japonica, and the hybrids between them display strong heterosis. However, hybrid sterility (HS) limits practical use of the heterosis between these two subspecies. S5 is a major-effect locus controlling the HS of female gametes in rice, consisting of three closely-linked genes ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 that act as a killer-protector system. The HS effects of S5 are inconsistent for different genetic backgrounds, indicating the existence of interacting genes within the genome.  Results: In the present study, the S5-interacting genes (SIG) and their effects on HS were analyzed by studying the hybrid progeny between an indica rice, Dular (DL) and a japonica rice, BalillaORF5+ (BLORF5+), with a transgenic ORF5+ allele. Four interacting quantitative trait loci (QTL): qSIG3.1, qSIG3.2, qSIG6.1, and qSIG12.1, were genetically mapped. To analyze the effect of each interacting locus, four near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed. The effect of each specific locus was investigated while the other three loci were kept DL homozygous (DL/DL). Of the four loci, qSIG3.1 was the SIG with the greatest effects in which the DL allele was completely dominant. Furthermore, the DL allele displayed incomplete dominance at qSIG3.2, qSIG6.1, and qSIG12.1. qSIG3.1 will be the first choice for further fine-mapping.  Conclusions: Four S5-interacting QTL were identified by genetic mapping and the effect of each locus was analyzed using advanced backcrossed NILs. The present study will facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanism of rice HS caused by S5. Additionally, it would provide the basis to explore the origin and differentiation of cultivated rice, having practical significance for inter-subspecific hybrid rice breeding programs.
