LEPTO1|OsRR24|DLC1	OHP2|OsAHP2	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of  Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis	LEPTO1 interacts with two authentic histidine phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via the DDK domain, and a phosphomimetic mutation of the DDK domain relieves its repression of LEPTO1 transactivation activity.
GL3.1|qGL3-1|qGL3|OsPPKL1	OHP2|OsAHP2	A Cryptic Inhibitor of Cytokinin Phosphorelay Controls Rice Grain Size	PPKL1 interacts with OsAHP2, one of authentic HPs, and D364 resides in a region resembling the receiver domain of RRs.
