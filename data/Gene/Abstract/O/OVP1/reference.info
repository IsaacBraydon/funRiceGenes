Vacuolar H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (V-PPase, EC 3.6.1.1) is an electrogenic proton pump and has been studied in many plants. Here we report characterization of the OVP1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.). Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis (RT-qPCR) showed that OVP1 was induced by cold stress. OVP1 overexpression resulted in enhanced cold tolerance in transgenic rice, which was related to an increased integrity of cell membrane, decreased MDA content and accumulation of proline to higher level as compared with wild type rice seedlings. These results indicated that V-PPase was an important element in the survival strategies of plants under cold stress.
