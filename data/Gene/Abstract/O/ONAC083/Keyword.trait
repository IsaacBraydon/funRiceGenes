ONAC083	transcription factor	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.
ONAC083	defense response	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	 Knockout of ONAC083 enhanced rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, strengthened pathogen-induced defense responses, and boosted chitin-induced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas ONAC083 overexpression had the opposite effects
ONAC083	defense	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	 Knockout of ONAC083 enhanced rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae, strengthened pathogen-induced defense responses, and boosted chitin-induced pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), whereas ONAC083 overexpression had the opposite effects
ONAC083	nucleus	The NAC transcription factor ONAC083 negatively regulates rice immunity against Magnaporthe oryzae by directly activating transcription of the RING-H2 gene OsRFPH2-6.	 ONAC083 localizes to the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activity that depended on its C-terminal region
