ONI3	shoot	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice	Loss-of-function mutations of ONI3, which were identified as mutants with ectopic expression of KNOX genes in leaves and morphologically resembling KNOX overexpressors, showed abnormal organ fusions in developing shoots
ONI3	shoot	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice	Expression analyses showed that ONI3 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer in the shoot apex throughout life cycle, and the oni3 mutants had an aberrant outermost cell layer
ONI3	shoot	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice
