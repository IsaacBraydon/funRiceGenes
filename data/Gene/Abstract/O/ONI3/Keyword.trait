ONI3	shoot	Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice	 Loss-of-function mutations of ONI3, which were identified as mutants with ectopic expression of KNOX genes in leaves and morphologically resembling KNOX overexpressors, showed abnormal organ fusions in developing shoots| Expression analyses showed that ONI3 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer in the shoot apex throughout life cycle, and the oni3 mutants had an aberrant outermost cell layer|Organ fusion and defective shoot development in oni3 mutants of rice
