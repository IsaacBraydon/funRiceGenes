OMTN3|OsNAC60	 We discovered that osa-miR164a expression reduced upon Guy11 infection at both early and late stages, which was perfectly associated with the induced expression of its target gene, OsNAC60 |  OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes |  The co-expression of OsNAC60 and osa-miR164a abolished the OsNAC60 activity, but not its synonymous mutant
