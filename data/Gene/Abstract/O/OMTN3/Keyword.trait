OMTN3|OsNAC60	drought resistance	Conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes negatively regulate drought resistance in rice	Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage.
OMTN3|OsNAC60	transcription factor	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes
OMTN3|OsNAC60	defense	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes
OMTN3|OsNAC60	defense response	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes
OMTN3|OsNAC60	blast	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
OMTN3|OsNAC60	magnaporthe oryzae	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.
