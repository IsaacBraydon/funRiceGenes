NA	Conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes negatively regulate drought resistance in rice	2014	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	MicroRNAs constitute a large group of endogenous small RNAs of ~22 nt that emerge as vital regulators, mainly by targeting mRNAs for post-transcriptional repression. Previous studies have revealed that the miR164 family in Arabidopsis is comprised of three members which guide the cleavage of the mRNAs of five NAC genes to modulate developmental processes. However, the functions of the miR164-targeted NAC genes in crops are poorly deciphered. In this study, the conserved features of six miR164-targeted NAC genes (OMTN1-OMTN6) in rice are described, and evidence is provided that four of them confer a negative regulatory role in drought resistance. OMTN proteins have the characteristics of typical NAC transcriptional factors. The miR164 recognition sites of the OMTN genes are highly conserved in rice germplasms. Deletion of the recognition sites impaired the transactivation activity, indicating that the conserved recognition sites play a crucial role in maintaining the function of the OMTN proteins. The OMTN genes were responsive to abiotic stresses, and showed diverse spatio-temporal expression patterns in rice. Overexpression of OMTN2, OMTN3, OMTN4, and OMTN6 in rice led to negative effects on drought resistance at the reproductive stage. The expression of numerous genes related to stress response, development, and metabolism was altered in OMTN2-, OMTN3-, OMTN4-, and OMTN6-overexpressing plants. Most of the up-regulated genes in the OMTN-overexpressing plants were down-regulated by drought stress. The results suggest that the conserved miR164-targeted NAC genes may be negative regulators of drought tolerance in rice, in addition to their reported roles in development.
NA	Osa-miR164a targets OsNAC60 and negatively regulates rice immunity against the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.	2018	Plant J	Department of Plant Pathology, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Exploring the regulatory mechanism played by endogenous rice miRNAs in defense responses against the blast disease is of great significance in both resistant variety breeding and disease control management. We identified rice defense-related miRNAs by comparing rice miRNA expression patterns before and after Magnaporthe oryzae strain Guy11 infection. We discovered that osa-miR164a expression reduced upon Guy11 infection at both early and late stages, which was perfectly associated with the induced expression of its target gene, OsNAC60. OsNAC60 encodes a transcription factor, over-expression of which enhanced defense responses, such as increased programmed cell death, greater ion leakage, more ROS accumulation and callose deposition, and up-regulation of defense-related genes. By using transgenic rice over-expressing osa-miR164a, and a transposon insertion mutant of OsNAC60, we showed that when the miR164a/OsNAC60 regulatory module was dysfunctional, rice developed significant susceptibility to Guy11 infection. The co-expression of OsNAC60 and osa-miR164a abolished the OsNAC60 activity, but not its synonymous mutant. We further validated that this regulatory module is conserved in plant resistance to multiple plant diseases such as the rice sheath blight, tomato late blight, and soybean root and stem rot diseases. Our results demonstrate that the miR164a/OsNAC60 regulatory module manipulates rice defense responses to M. oryzae infection. This discovery is of great potential for resistant variety breeding and disease control to a broad spectrum of pathogens in the future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
