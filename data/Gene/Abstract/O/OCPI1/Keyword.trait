OCPI1	seed	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice	 The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
OCPI1	grain	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice	 The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
OCPI1	salt	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice	 The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses
OCPI1	yield	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice	 The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected
OCPI1	drought	Characterization of a stress responsive proteinase inhibitor gene with positive effect in improving drought resistance in rice	" The expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of OCPI1 promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt stresses| The positive transgenic plants (OCPI1 was over-expressed) had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no over-expression of the transgene) under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not affected| Taken together, these data indicate that OCPI1 might potentially be useful in the genetic improvement of drought resistance in rice"
