The Spo0B-associated GTP-binding protein (Obg) GTPase, essential for bacterial viability, is also conserved in eukaryotes, but its primary role in eukaryotes remains unknown. Here, our functional characterization of Arabidopsis and rice obgc mutants strongly underlines the evolutionarily conserved role of eukaryotic Obgs in organellar ribosome biogenesis. The mutants exhibited a chlorotic phenotype, caused by retarded chloroplast development. A plastid DNA macroarray revealed a plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP) deficiency in an obgc mutant, caused by incompleteness of the PEP complex, as its western blot exhibited reduced levels of RpoA protein, a component of PEP. Plastid rRNA profiling indicated that plastid rRNA processing is defective in obgc mutants, probably resulting in impaired ribosome biogenesis and, in turn, in reduced levels of RpoA protein. RNA co-immunoprecipitation revealed that ObgC specifically co-precipitates with 23S rRNA in vivo. These findings indicate that ObgC functions primarily in plastid ribosome biogenesis during chloroplast development. Furthermore, complementation analysis can provide new insights into the functional modes of three ObgC domains, including the Obg fold, G domain and OCT.
NA	Oryza sativa ObgC1 Acts as a Key Regulator of DNA Replication and Ribosome Biogenesis in Chloroplast Nucleoids	2021	Rice (N Y)	College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Background: The Spo0B-associated GTP-binding protein (Obg) GTPase, has diverse and important functions in bacteria, including morphological development, DNA replication and ribosome maturation. Homologs of the Bacillus subtilis Obg have been also found in chloroplast of Oryza sativa, but their primary roles remain unknown.  Results: We clarify that OsObgC1 is a functional homolog of AtObgC. The mutant obgc1-d1 exhibited hypersensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. Quantitative PCR results showed that the ratio of chloroplast DNA to nuclear DNA in the mutants was higher than that of the wild-type plants. After DAPI staining, OsObgC1 mutants showed abnormal nucleoid architectures. The specific punctate staining pattern of OsObgC1-GFP signal suggests that this protein localizes to the chloroplast nucleoids. Furthermore, loss-of-function mutation in OsObgC1 led to a severe suppression of protein biosynthesis by affecting plastid rRNA processing. It was also demonstrated through rRNA profiling that plastid rRNA processing was decreased in obgc1-d mutants, which resulted in impaired ribosome biogenesis. The sucrose density gradient profiles revealed a defective chloroplast ribosome maturation of obgc1-d1 mutants.  Conclusion: Our findings here indicate that the OsObgC1 retains the evolutionarily biological conserved roles of prokaryotic Obg, which acts as a signaling hub that regulates DNA replication and ribosome biogenesis in chloroplast nucleoids.
