OPT|OsOPT7	leaf	OsTZF1, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes	 Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues
OPT|OsOPT7	panicle	OsTZF1, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes	 Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues
OPT|OsOPT7	root	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development
OPT|OsOPT7	growth	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Furthermore OsOPT7 did not complement the growth of yeast fet3fet4 mutant
OPT|OsOPT7	shoot	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Microarray analysis of OsOPT7 knockout 1 (opt7-1) revealed the upregulation of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes in plants grown under Fe-sufficient conditions, despite the high Fe and ferritin concentrations in shoot tissue indicating that Fe may not be available for physiological functions
OPT|OsOPT7	seed	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development
OPT|OsOPT7	homeostasis	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.
OPT|OsOPT7	development	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development
OPT|OsOPT7	plasma membrane	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 OsOPT7 localized to the plasma membrane and did not transport Fe(III)-DMA or Fe(II)-NA and GSH in Xenopus laevis oocytes
OPT|OsOPT7	seed development	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	 Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development
OPT|OsOPT7	iron	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.
OPT|OsOPT7	iron homeostasis	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.
