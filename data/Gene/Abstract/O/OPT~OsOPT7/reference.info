Jan-2013-OsTZF1, a CCCH-tande.pdf	OsTZF1, a CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein, confers delayed senescence and stress tolerance in rice by regulating stress-related genes	2013	Plant Physiol	Biological Resources and Post-harvest Division, Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8686, Japan.	OsTZF1 is a member of the CCCH-type zinc finger gene family in rice (Oryza sativa). Expression of OsTZF1 was induced by drought, high-salt stress, and hydrogen peroxide. OsTZF1 gene expression was also induced by abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid. Histochemical activity of beta-glucuronidase in transgenic rice plants containing the promoter of OsTZF1 fused with beta-glucuronidase was observed in callus, coleoptile, young leaf, and panicle tissues. Upon stress, OsTZF1-green fluorescent protein localization was observed in the cytoplasm and cytoplasmic foci. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTZF1 driven by a maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter (Ubi:OsTZF1-OX [for overexpression]) exhibited delayed seed germination, growth retardation at the seedling stage, and delayed leaf senescence. RNA interference (RNAi) knocked-down plants (OsTZF1-RNAi) showed early seed germination, enhanced seedling growth, and early leaf senescence compared with controls. Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants showed improved tolerance to high-salt and drought stresses and vice versa for OsTZF1-RNAi plants. Microarray analysis revealed that genes related to stress, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and metal homeostasis were regulated in the Ubi:OsTZF1-OX plants. RNA-binding assays indicated that OsTZF1 binds to U-rich regions in the 3' untranslated region of messenger RNAs, suggesting that OsTZF1 might be associated with RNA metabolism of stress-responsive genes. OsTZF1 may serve as a useful biotechnological tool for the improvement of stress tolerance in various plants through the control of RNA metabolism of stress-responsive genes.
NA	Iron deficiency regulated OsOPT7 is essential for iron homeostasis in rice.	2015	Plant Mol Biol	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8657, Japan.	The molecular mechanism of iron (Fe) uptake and transport in plants are well-characterized; however, many components of Fe homeostasis remain unclear. We cloned iron-deficiency-regulated oligopeptide transporter 7 (OsOPT7) from rice. OsOPT7 localized to the plasma membrane and did not transport Fe(III)-DMA or Fe(II)-NA and GSH in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Furthermore OsOPT7 did not complement the growth of yeast fet3fet4 mutant. OsOPT7 was specifically upregulated in response to Fe-deficiency. Promoter GUS analysis revealed that OsOPT7 expresses in root tips, root vascular tissue and shoots as well as during seed development. Microarray analysis of OsOPT7 knockout 1 (opt7-1) revealed the upregulation of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes in plants grown under Fe-sufficient conditions, despite the high Fe and ferritin concentrations in shoot tissue indicating that Fe may not be available for physiological functions. Plants overexpressing OsOPT7 do not exhibit any phenotype and do not accumulate more Fe compared to wild type plants. These results indicate that OsOPT7 may be involved in Fe transport in rice.
