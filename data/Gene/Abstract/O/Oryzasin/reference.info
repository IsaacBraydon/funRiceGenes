Asakura-1995-Rice aspartic protei.pdf	Rice Aspartic Proteinase, Oryzasin, Expressed During Seed Ripening and Germination, has a Gene Organization Distinct from Those of Animal and Microbial Aspartic Proteinases	1995	European Journal of Biochemistry	Laboratory for Food Science, Atomi Junior College, Tokyo, Japan.	The gene organization and nucleotide sequence of an aspartic proteinase (AP) of plant origin were first disclosed by cDNA and genomic DNA cloning of a rice AP (oryzasin). The deduced amino acid sequence of oryzasin 1 was significantly similar to those of other APs (34-85%), with highest similarity (85%) to barley AP (HvAP). Oryzasin 1, as well as HvAP, is distinct from animal and microbial APs in that the plant APs contain a unique 104-amino-acid insertion in the C-terminal region. The oryzasin 1 gene spans approximately 6.6 kbp and is composed of 14 exons and 13 introns. The exon-intron organization of the oryzasin 1 gene is totally different from those of genes for animal and microbial APs such as human cathepsin D, rat renin, bovine chymosin, aspergillopepsin A of Aspergillus awamori, proteinase A of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and rhizopuspepsin of Rhizopus niveus, despite the fact that oryzasin 1 shows overall sequence similarity to these APs.
Huang-2013-OsAP65, a rice aspar.pdf	OsAP65, a rice aspartic protease, is essential for male fertility and plays a role in pollen germination and pollen tube growth	2013	J Exp Bot	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Aspartic proteases (APs) comprise a large proteolytic enzyme family widely distributed in animals, microbes, viruses, and plants. The rice genome encodes 96 APs, of which only a few have been functionally characterized. Here, the identification and characterization of a novel AP gene, OsAP65, which plays an indispensable role in pollen tube growth in rice, is reported. The T-DNA insertion line of OsAP65 caused severe segregation distortion. In the progeny derived from an individual heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion, the wild type and T-DNA-carrying heterozygote segregated at a ratio close to 1:1, while homozygotes of disrupted OsAP65 (OsAP65-/-) were not recovered. Reciprocal crosses between heterozygotes and wild-type plants demonstrated that the mutant alleles could not be transmitted through the male gamete. Examination of the anthers from heterozygous plants revealed that the mutant pollen matured normally, but did not germinate or elongate. OsAP65 was expressed in various tissues and the transcript level in heterozygous plants was about half of the amount measured in the wild-type plants. The subcellular localization showed that OsAP65 is a pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) protein. These results indicated that OsAP65 was essential for rice pollen germination and tube growth.
