Mori-2005-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of the origin recognition complex (ORC) from a higher plant, rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2005	Gene	Department of Applied Biological Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Science University of Tokyo, 2641 Yamazaki, Noda-shi, Chiba-ken 278-8510, Japan.	The origin recognition complex (ORC) protein plays a critical role in DNA replication through binding to sites (origins) where replication commences. The protein is composed of six subunits (ORC1 to 6) in animals and yeasts. Our knowledge of the ORC protein in plants is, however, much less complete. We have performed cDNA cloning and characterization of ORC subunits in rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) in order to facilitate study of plant DNA replication mechanisms. Our previous report provided a description of a gene, ORC1 (OsORC1), that encodes one of the protein subunits. The present report extends this initial analysis to include the genes that encode four other rice ORC subunits, OsORC2, 3, 4 and 5. Northern hybridization analyses demonstrated the presence of abundant transcripts for all OsORC subunits in shoot apical meristems (SAM) and cultured cells, but not in mature leaves. Interestingly, only OsORC5 showed high levels of expression in organs in which cell proliferation is not active, such as flag leaves, the ears and the non-tip roots. The pattern of expression of OsORC2 also differed from other OsORC subunits. When cell proliferation was temporarily halted for 6-10 days by removal of sucrose from the growth medium, expression of OsORC1, OsORC3, OsORC4 and OsORC5 was substantially reduced. However, the level of expression of OsORC2 remained constant. We suggest from these results that expression of OsORC1, 3, 4 and 5 are correlated with cell proliferation, but the expression of OsORC2 is not.
Shultz-2007-Genome-wide analysis.pdf	Genome-wide analysis of the core DNA replication machinery in the higher plants Arabidopsis and rice	2007	Plant Physiol	Department of Plant Biology , North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina 27695, USA.	Core DNA replication proteins mediate the initiation, elongation, and Okazaki fragment maturation functions of DNA replication. Although this process is generally conserved in eukaryotes, important differences in the molecular architecture of the DNA replication machine and the function of individual subunits have been reported in various model systems. We have combined genome-wide bioinformatic analyses of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) with published experimental data to provide a comprehensive view of the core DNA replication machinery in plants. Many components identified in this analysis have not been studied previously in plant systems, including the GINS (go ichi ni san) complex (PSF1, PSF2, PSF3, and SLD5), MCM8, MCM9, MCM10, NOC3, POLA2, POLA3, POLA4, POLD3, POLD4, and RNASEH2. Our results indicate that the core DNA replication machinery from plants is more similar to vertebrates than single-celled yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), suggesting that animal models may be more relevant to plant systems. However, we also uncovered some important differences between plants and vertebrate machinery. For example, we did not identify geminin or RNASEH1 genes in plants. Our analyses also indicate that plants may be unique among eukaryotes in that they have multiple copies of numerous core DNA replication genes. This finding raises the question of whether specialized functions have evolved in some cases. This analysis establishes that the core DNA replication machinery is highly conserved across plant species and displays many features in common with other eukaryotes and some characteristics that are unique to plants.
