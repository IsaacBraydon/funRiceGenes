D6|OSH15|Oskn3	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
DLT|OsGRAS-32|D62|GS6|SMOS2	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Here, we identified OFP3 (OVATE FAMILY PROTEIN 3) as an interactor of both GSK2 and DLT by yeast two-hybrid screening and demonstrated that OFP3 plays a distinctly negative role in BR responses
GF14c	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.

GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Moreover, treatment with either BR or bikinin, a GSK3-like kinase inhibitor, induced OFP3 depletion, whereas GSK2 or brassinazole, a BR synthesis inhibitor, promoted OFP3 accumulation
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Importantly, GSK2 can phosphorylate OFP3 and enhance these interactions
GSK2|OsGSK2|OsSK22	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 We propose that OFP3, as a suppressor of both BR synthesis and signaling but stabilized by GSK2, incorporates into a transcription factor complex to facilitate BR signaling control, which is critical for the proper development of various tissues
OFP1	OFP3	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
OFP3	OsBZR1	GSK2 Stabilizes OFP3 to Suppress Brassinosteroid Responses in Rice.	 Furthermore, OFP3 exhibited transcription repressor activity and was able to interact with itself as well as additional BR-related components, including OFP1, OSH1, OSH15, OsBZR1, and GF14c
