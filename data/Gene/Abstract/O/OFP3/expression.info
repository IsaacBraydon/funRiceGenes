OFP3	 While knockout of OFP3 promoted rice seedling growth, overexpression of OFP3 led to strong BR insensitivity, which resulted in reduced plant height, leaf angle, and grain size |  OFP3 overexpression also enhanced the phenotypes of BR-deficient mutants, but largely suppressed those of BR-enhanced plants	 While knockout of OFP3 promoted rice seedling growth, overexpression of OFP3 led to strong BR insensitivity, which resulted in reduced plant height, leaf angle, and grain size |  OFP3 overexpression also enhanced the phenotypes of BR-deficient mutants, but largely suppressed those of BR-enhanced plants
