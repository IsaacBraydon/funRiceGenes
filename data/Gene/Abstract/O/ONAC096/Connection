Gn1a|OsCKX2	ONAC096	Mutation of ONAC096 Enhances Grain Yield by Increasing Panicle Number and Delaying Leaf Senescence during Grain Filling in Rice.	 Repressed OsCKX2 (encoding cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) expression in the onac096 mutants led to a 15% increase in panicle number without affecting grain weight or fertility
ONAC096	OsRap2.6|OsERF101	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.
ONAC096	OsWRKY62	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.
ONAC096	PAL|OsPAL4|OsPAL1	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.
ONAC096	OsWRKY45|WRKY45	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	 CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of ONAC096 attenuated rice immunity and flg22-induced reactive oxygen species burst and expression of PTI marker genes OsWRKY45 and OsPAL4; by contrast, overexpression of ONAC096 enhanced rice immunity or flg22-induced PTI
ONAC096	SNAC3|ONAC066|OsNAC006	A Pathogen-Inducible Rice NAC Transcription Factor ONAC096 Contributes to Immunity Against Magnaprothe oryzae and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae by Direct Binding to the Promoters of OsRap2.6, OsWRKY62, and OsPAL1.	 ONAC096 interacts with ONAC066, which is a positive regulator of rice immunity
