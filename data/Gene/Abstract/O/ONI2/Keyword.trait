ONI2	leaf	ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice	The midrib of oni2 leaf blades was not developed correctly
ONI2	shoot	ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice	onion2 (oni2) mutants produced very small shoots in which leaves were fused to each other, and ceased growing after germination
ONI2	shoot	ONION2 fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice	These results suggest that ONI2 is a layer 1-specific gene required for development of the entire shoot and that VLCFAs play an essential role in normal shoot development in rice
