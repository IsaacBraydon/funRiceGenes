OLE16	OLE18	Different effects on triacylglycerol packaging to oil bodies in transgenic rice seeds by specifically eliminating one of their two oleosin isoforms.	Expression of OLE16 and OLE18, two oleosin isoforms in oil bodies of rice seeds, was suppressed by RNA interference
OLE16	OLE18	Different effects on triacylglycerol packaging to oil bodies in transgenic rice seeds by specifically eliminating one of their two oleosin isoforms.	 In comparison to wild-type plants, OLE18 levels were reduced to approximately 40% when OLE16 was completely eliminated in 35S::ole16i transgenic plants
OLE16	OLE18	Different effects on triacylglycerol packaging to oil bodies in transgenic rice seeds by specifically eliminating one of their two oleosin isoforms.	 In contrast, OLE16 was reduced to only 80% of wild-type levels when OLE18 was completely eliminated in 35S::ole18i transgenic plants
