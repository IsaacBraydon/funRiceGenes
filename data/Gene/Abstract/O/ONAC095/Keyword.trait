ONAC095	drought	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.
ONAC095	drought	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.	Expression of ONAC095 was up-regulated by drought stress and abscisic acid (ABA) but down-regulated by cold stress
ONAC095	drought	Rice NAC transcription factor ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance.	Functional analyses through dominant chimeric repressor-mediated suppression of ONAC095 demonstrate that ONAC095 plays opposite roles in drought and cold stress tolerance, acting as a negative regulator of drought response but as a positive regulator of cold response in rice
