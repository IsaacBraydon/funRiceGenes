We identified four histidine kinase (HK) genes of a cytokinin receptor family, two histidine-containing phosphotransmitter (HPt) genes, thirteen A-type response regulator (RR) genes and six B-type RR genes in the rice genome. The HK genes (OHK2, OHK3, OHK4 and OHK5 for Oryza sativa HK), the HPt genes (OHP1 and OHP2 for O. sativa HPt) and the B-type RR genes (ORR1, ORR2, ORR3, ORR4 and ORR6 for O. sativa RR) except one (ORR5) showed expression in various organs. ORR5 was expressed in callus and flower. Three A-type RR genes (OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10 for O. sativa RR) showed cytokinin-induced expression, and three (OsRR8, OsRR12 and OsRR13) showed expression in flower. We also identified two other genes named OHK1 and CHARK (CHASE domain Receptor-like serine/threonine Kinase). OHK1 encodes an HK similar to Arabidopsis CKI1, which is involved in female gametophyte development. CHARK encodes a protein with an extracellular cytokinin-perceiving CHASE domain and a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain which are connected with a single transmembrane domain. The presence of all four gene families and CHARK in the rice genome suggests that a cytokinin signal is transduced by the phosphotransfer mechanism as is the case in Arabidopsis, and that rice may have an additional novel signalling pathway involving serine/threonine phosphorylation.
NA	The OsRR24/LEPTO1 Type-B Response Regulator is Essential for the Organization of Leptotene Chromosomes in Rice Meiosis.	2018	Plant Cell	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences CITY: Beijing China [CN].	Response regulators play significant roles in controlling various biological processes; however, their roles in plant meiosis remain unclear. Here, we report the identification of OsRR24/LEPTOTENE1 (LEPTO1), a rice (Oryza sativa) type-B response regulator that participates in the establishment of key molecular and morphological features of chromosomes in leptotene, an early stage of prophase I in meiosis. Although meiosis initiates normally, as indicated by staining of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the meiotic chromosomes in lepto1 mutant pollen mother cells (PMCs) fail to form the thin thread-like structures that are typical of leptotene chromosomes in wild-type PMCs. Furthermore, lepto1 mutants fail to form chromosomal double-strand breaks, do not recruit meiosis-specific proteins to the meiotic chromosomes, and show disrupted callose deposition. LEPTO1 is also essential for programmed cell death in tapetal cells. LEPTO1 contains a conserved signal receiver domain (DDK) and a myb-like DNA binding domain (MYB) at the N terminus. LEPTO1 interacts with two authentic histidine phosphotransfer (AHP) proteins, OsAHP1 and OsAHP2, via the DDK domain, and a phosphomimetic mutation of the DDK domain relieves its repression of LEPTO1 transactivation activity. Collectively, our results show that OsRR24/LEPTO1 plays a significant role in the leptotene phase of meiotic prophase I.
