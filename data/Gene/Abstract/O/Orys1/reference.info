We have isolated and characterized a cDNA clone, Ory s 1, encoding a group-1 allergen of rice pollen. The Ory s 1 protein shows significant sequence identity to the major allergen of rye-grass pollen, Lol p 1. RNA gel blot analysis shows that the Ory s 1 gene is expressed in mature anthers, but not in vegetative or other floral tissues tested. Southern blot analysis indicates that this clone represents a member of a small gene family in rice. Western blot analyses of total rice pollen proteins with the group-1 allergen-specific monoclonal 3A2 and IgE antibodies from grass pollen-allergic patients, revealed the presence of cross-reactive antigenic and allergenic epitopes in Ory s 1.

A simple protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Australian rice using mature embryos is described. Transgenic plants of two commercial genotypes of Australian rice, Amaroo and Millin, were produced. Transgenic plants were obtained by applying selection pressure to callus and to the regenerated shoots. Exclusion of the selective agent (hygromycin) during plant regeneration was found to be critical for recovery of transgenic plants from these commercial varieties. Transgenic plants were produced after 3 months. The developed system was also used to study spatial and temporal expression of a rice pollen-specific gene, Ory s 1. Expression of pOry s 1::uidA in transgenic rice demonstrated GUS expression in mature pollen, hence indicating potential use of this promoter to direct pollen-specific gene expression. Further Ory s 1 5' deletion study indicated that the pollen-specificity element may reside within -405 bp to the start of the transcription, while the region upstream of -405 contained a cis-acting regulatory element(s) responsible for quantitative expression of this gene.
