ONAC023|OsNAC23	seed	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels
ONAC023|OsNAC23	nucleus	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively

ONAC023|OsNAC23	transcription factor	The OsNAC23-Tre6P-SnRK1a feed-forward loop regulates sugar homeostasis and grain yield in rice.	 Here, we report that the sugar-inducible rice NAC transcription factor OsNAC23 directly represses the transcription of the Tre6P phosphatase gene TPP1 to simultaneously elevate Tre6P and repress trehalose levels, thus facilitating carbon partitioning from source to sink organs
ONAC023|OsNAC23	sugar	The OsNAC23-Tre6P-SnRK1a feed-forward loop regulates sugar homeostasis and grain yield in rice.	 Importantly, plants over-expressing OsNAC23 exhibited an elevated photosynthetic rate, sugar transport, and sink organ size, which consistently increased rice yields by 13%-17% in three elite-variety backgrounds and two locations, suggesting that manipulation of OsNAC23 expression has great potential for rice improvement
