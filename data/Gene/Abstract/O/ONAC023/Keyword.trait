ONAC023	seed	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels
ONAC023	nucleus	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively
ONAC023	seed development	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels
