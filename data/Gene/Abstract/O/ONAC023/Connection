ONAC023|OsNAC23	SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	The OsNAC23-Tre6P-SnRK1a feed-forward loop regulates sugar homeostasis and grain yield in rice.	 Meanwhile, OsNAC23 and Tre6P suppress the transcription and enzyme activity of SnRK1a, a low-carbon sensor and antagonist of OsNAC23, to prevent the SnRK1a-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of OsNAC23
ONAC023|OsNAC23	SnRK1A|OsSnRK1a|OsSnRK1A1	The OsNAC23-Tre6P-SnRK1a feed-forward loop regulates sugar homeostasis and grain yield in rice.	 Thus, OsNAC23, Tre6P, and SnRK1a formÂ a feed-forward loop to sense sugar and maintain sugar homeostasis by transporting sugars to sink organs
