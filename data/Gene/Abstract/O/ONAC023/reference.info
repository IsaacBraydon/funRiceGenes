NA	Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated with Seed Size.	2016	Front Plant Sci	National Institute of Plant Genome Research New Delhi, India.	NACs are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) involved in multiple aspects of development and stress. In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONAC020, ONAC026, and ONAC023 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels. They exhibit significantly strong association with seed size/weight with the sequence variations located in the upstream regulatory region. Concomitantly, their expression pattern/levels during seed development vary amongst different accessions with variation in seed size. The alterations in the promoter sequences of the three genes, amongst the five rice accessions, correlate with the expression levels to a certain extent only. In terms of transcriptional properties, the three NAC TFs can activate and/or suppress downstream genes, though to different extents. Only ONAC026 is localized to the nucleus while ONAC020 and ONAC023 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively. Interestingly, these two proteins interact with ONAC026 and the dimers localize in the nucleus. Trans-splicing between ONAC020 and ONAC026 results in three additional forms of ONAC020. The transcriptional properties including activation, repression, subcellular localization and heterodimerization of trans-spliced forms of ONAC020 and ONAC026 are different, indicating toward their role as competitors. The analysis presented in this paper helps to conclude that the three NAC genes, which are associated with seed size, have independent as well as overlapping roles during the process and can be exploited as potential targets for crop improvement.
NA	The OsNAC23-Tre6P-SnRK1a feed-forward loop regulates sugar homeostasis and grain yield in rice.	2022	Mol Plant	State Key Lab of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 311400, China; College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Tre6P (trehalose-6-phosphate) mediates sensing of carbon availability to maintain sugar homeostasis in plants, which underpins crop yield and resilience. However, how Tre6P responds to fluctuations in sugar levels and regulates the utilization of sugars for growth remains to be addressed. Here, we report that the sugar-inducible rice NAC transcription factor OsNAC23 directly represses the transcription of the Tre6P phosphatase gene TPP1 to simultaneously elevate Tre6P and repress trehalose levels, thus facilitating carbon partitioning from source to sink organs. Meanwhile, OsNAC23 and Tre6P suppress the transcription and enzyme activity of SnRK1a, a low-carbon sensor and antagonist of OsNAC23, to prevent the SnRK1a-mediated phosphorylation and degradation of OsNAC23. Thus, OsNAC23, Tre6P, and SnRK1a formÂ a feed-forward loop to sense sugar and maintain sugar homeostasis by transporting sugars to sink organs. Importantly, plants over-expressing OsNAC23 exhibited an elevated photosynthetic rate, sugar transport, and sink organ size, which consistently increased rice yields by 13%-17% in three elite-variety backgrounds and two locations, suggesting that manipulation of OsNAC23 expression has great potential for rice improvement. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of Tre6P-mediated sugar signaling and homeostasis, and provide a new strategy for genetic improvement of rice and possibly also other crops.
