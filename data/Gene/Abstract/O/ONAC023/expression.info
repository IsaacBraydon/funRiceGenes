ONAC023|OsNAC23	 Importantly, plants over-expressing OsNAC23 exhibited an elevated photosynthetic rate, sugar transport, and sink organ size, which consistently increased rice yields by 13%-17% in three elite-variety backgrounds and two locations, suggesting that manipulation of OsNAC23 expression has great potential for rice improvement
