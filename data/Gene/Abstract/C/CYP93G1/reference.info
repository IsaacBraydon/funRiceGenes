NA	Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.	2014	Plant Physiol	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China (P.Y.L., F.-Y.Z., W.L.C., C.L.); andState Key Laboratory Breeding Base for Zhejiang Sustainable Pest and Disease Control, Institute of Crops and Nuclear Technology Utilization, Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Hangzhou 310021, China (H.L.).	Flavones are a major class of flavonoids with a wide range of physiological functions in plants. They are constitutively accumulated as C-glycosides and O-linked conjugates in vegetative tissues of grasses. It has long been presumed that the two structural modifications of flavones occur through independent metabolic routes. Previously, we reported that cytochrome P450 93G2 (CYP93G2) functions as a flavanone 2-hydroxylase (F2H) that provides 2-hydroxyflavanones for C-glycosylation in rice (Oryza sativa). Flavone C-glycosides are subsequently formed by dehydratase activity on 2-hydroxyflavanone C-glycosides. On the other hand, O-linked modifications were proposed to proceed after the flavone nucleus is generated. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones. In recombinant enzyme assays, CYP93G1 desaturated naringenin and eriodictyol to apigenin and luteolin, respectively. Consistently, transgenic expression of CYP93G1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in the accumulation of different flavone O-glycosides, which are not naturally present in cruciferous plants. Metabolite analysis of a rice CYP93G1 insertion mutant further demonstrated the preferential depletion of tricin O-linked flavanolignans and glycosides. By contrast, redirection of metabolic flow to the biosynthesis of flavone C-glycosides was observed. Our findings established that CYP93G1 is a key branch point enzyme channeling flavanones to the biosynthesis of tricin O-linked conjugates in rice. Functional diversification of F2H and FNSII in the cytochrome P450 CYP93G subfamily may represent a lineage-specific event leading to the prevalent cooccurrence of flavone C- and O-linked derivatives in grasses today.
NA	Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility.	2017	Plant Physiol	The University of Hong Kong CITY: Hong Kong Hong Kong [HK].	Lignin, a ubiquitous phenylpropanoid polymer in vascular plant cell walls, is primarily derived from oxidative couplings of monolignols (p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols). It was recently discovered that a wide range of grasses, including cereals, utilize a member of flavonoid, tricin (3',5'-dimethoxyflavone), as a natural co-monomer with monolignols for cell wall lignification. Previously, we established that cytochrome P450 93G1 is a flavone synthase II (OsFNSII) indispensable for the biosynthesis of soluble tricin-derived metabolites in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, our tricin-deficient fnsII mutant was further analyzed with an emphasis on its cell wall structure and properties. The mutant is similar in growth to the wild-type control plants with normal vascular morphology. Chemical and NMR structural analyses demonstrated that the mutant lignin is completely devoid of tricin, indicating that FNSII activity is essential for deposition of tricin-bound lignin in rice cell walls. The mutant also showed substantially reduced lignin content with decreased syringyl/guaiacyl lignin unit composition. Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII. The fnsII mutant was further revealed to have enhanced enzymatic saccharification efficiency, suggesting that cell wall recalcitrance of grass biomass may be reduced through manipulation of flavonoid monomer supply for lignification.
