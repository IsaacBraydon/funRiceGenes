CYP93G1|OsFNSII	lignin	Disrupting Flavone Synthase II Alters Lignin and Improves Biomass Digestibility.	 Interestingly, the loss of tricin in the mutant lignin appears to be partially compensated by incorporating naringenin which is a preferred substrate of OsFNSII
CYP93G1|OsFNSII	seed	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	 Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield
