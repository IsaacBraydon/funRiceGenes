CYP93G1|OsFNSII	CYP93G2|qST-6.1	Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.	In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones
CYP93G1|OsFNSII	CYP93G2|qST-6.1	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	 Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield
