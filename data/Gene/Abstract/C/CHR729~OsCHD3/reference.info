Histone lysine methylation is an important component of the epigenetic system demarcating transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin domains. It is of primary importance in understanding how different histone lysine methylation marks and a specific combination of them are read and interpreted by chromatin proteins to regulate gene expression. In this paper, we report that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 that was required for many aspects of plant development can interact with dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2, a mark associated with moderately expressed or repressed genes) and with trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3, a mark associated with repressed genes), respectively, through the chromodomains and the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of the protein. A mutation or down-regulation of the gene provoked a decrease of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (a mark associated with active genes). Genome-wide analysis revealed that H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, respectively, were lost from about 56 and 23% of marked loci, which correspond mostly to under-expressed or repressed genes. In the mutant, a higher-than-expected proportion of down-regulated genes lost H3K4me3, among which many encode DNA-binding transcription factors. These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein is a bifunctional chromatin regulator able to recognize and modulate H3K4 and H3K27 methylation over repressed or tissue-specific genes, which may be associated with regulation of a gene transcription program of plant development.
NA	CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.	2015	PLoS One	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, China.	CHD3 is one of the chromatin-remodeling factors that contribute to controlling the expression of genes associated with plant development. Loss-of-function mutants display morphological and growth defects. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CHD3 regulation of plant development remain unclear. In this study, a rice CHD3 protein, CHR729, was identified. The corresponding mutant line (t483) exhibited late seed germination, low germination rate, dwarfism, low tiller number, root growth inhibition, adaxial albino leaves, and short and narrow leaves. CHR729 encoded a nuclear protein and was expressed in almost all organs. RNA-sequencing analysis showed that several plant hormone-related genes were up- or down-regulated in t483 compared to wild type. In particular, expression of the gibberellin synthetase gibberellin 20 oxidase 4 gene was elevated in the mutant. Endogenous gibberellin assays demonstrated that the content of bioactive GA3 was reduced in t483 compared to wild type. Moreover, the seedling dwarfism, late seed germination, and short root length phenotypes of t483 were partially rescued by treatment with exogenous GA3. These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway.
NA	CRL6, a member of the CHD protein family, is required for crown root development in rice	2016	Plant Physiology and Biochemistry	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China	The root system in monocotyledonous plants is largely composed of postembryonic shoot-borne roots named crown roots, which are important for nutrients and water uptake. The molecular mechanism underlying regulation of crown root development is not fully explored. In this study, we characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in crown root formation, designated as crown rootless6 (crl6). Histological analysis showed that CRL6 influences crown root formation by regulating primordial initiation and development. Map-based cloning and subsequent complementation tests verified that the CRL6 gene encodes a member of the large chromodomain, helicase/ATPase, and DNA-binding domain (CHD) family protein. Realtime RT-PCR analysis showed that CRL6 was most highly expressed in the stem base region where crown roots initiated. In addition, auxin-action inhibited phenotype was observed during crl6 development. The expressions of OsIAA genes were down-regulated in crl6. Our results provide evidence that CRL6 plays an important role in crown root development in rice via auxin-related signaling pathway.

NA	The Rice Rolled Fine Striped (RFS) CHD3/Mi-2 Chromatin Remodeling Factor Epigenetically Regulates Genes Involved in Oxidative Stress Responses During Leaf Development.	2018	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.	In rice (Oryza sativa), moderate leaf rolling increases photosynthetic competence and raises grain yield; therefore, this important agronomic trait has attracted much attention from plant biologists and breeders. However, the relevant molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we isolated and characterizedRolled Fine Striped(RFS), a key gene affecting rice leaf rolling, chloroplast development, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. Therfs-1gamma-ray allele and therfs-2T-DNA insertion allele ofRFSfailed to complement each other and their mutants had similar phenotypes, producing extremely incurved leaves due to defective development of vascular cells on the adaxial side. Map-based cloning showed that therfs-1mutant harbors a 9-bp deletion in a gene encoding a predicted CHD3/Mi-2 chromatin remodeling factor belonging to the SNF2-ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling family.RFSwas expressed in various tissues and accumulated mainly in the vascular cells throughout leaf development. Furthermore,RFSdeficiency resulted in a cell death phenotype that was caused by ROS accumulation in developing leaves. We found that expression of five ROS-scavenging genes [encoding catalase C, ascorbate peroxidase 8, a putative copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD), a putative SOD, and peroxiredoxin IIE2] decreased inrfs-2mutants. Western-blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated thatrfs-2mutants have reduced H3K4me3 levels in ROS-related genes. Loss-of-function inRFSalso led to multiple developmental defects, affecting pollen development, grain filling, and root development. Our results suggest that RFS is required for many aspects of plant development and its function is closely associated with epigenetic regulation of genes that modulate ROS homeostasis.
NA	A Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-like Binding Factor Functions in Chromatin Modification and Gene Regulation.	2020	Plant Physiol.	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan city POSTAL_CODE: 430070 China	Proteins in the chromodomain-helicase/ATPase-DNA-binding domain (CHD) family are divided into three groups. The function of group I CHD proteins in nucleosome positioning is well established, while that of group II members (represented by CHD3/Mi2) remains unclear. Using high-throughput approaches, we investigated the function of the group II rice (Oryza sativa) CHD protein CHR729 in nucleosome positioning, gene expression, histone methylation, and binding. Our data revealed that the chr729 mutation led to increased nucleosome occupancy in the rice genome and altered the expression and histone H3K4me3 modification of many, mainly underexpressed, genes. Further analysis showed that the mutation affected both deposition and depletion of H3K4me3 in distinct chromatin regions with concomitant changes in H3K27me3 modification. Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes. In addition, CHR729 binding was enriched in H3K4me3-marked genic and H3K27me3-marked intergenic regions. The results indicate that CHR729 has distinct functions in regulating H3K4me3 and H3K27me3modifications, and gene expression at different chromatin domains and provide insight into chromatin regulation of 'bivalent' genes marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.
