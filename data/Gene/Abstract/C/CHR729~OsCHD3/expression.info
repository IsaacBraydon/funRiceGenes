Symbol	Expression
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6	 The expressions of OsIAA genes were down-regulated in crl6
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	 We found that expression of five ROS-scavenging genes [encoding catalase C, ascorbate peroxidase 8, a putative copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD), a putative SOD, and peroxiredoxin IIE2] decreased inrfs-2mutants
