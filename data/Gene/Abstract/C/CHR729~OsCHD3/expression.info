Symbol	Expression
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6	 The expressions of OsIAA genes were down-regulated in crl6
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	 We found that expression of five ROS-scavenging genes [encoding catalase C, ascorbate peroxidase 8, a putative copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD), a putative SOD, and peroxiredoxin IIE2] decreased inrfs-2mutants
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	 Using high-throughput approaches, we investigated the function of the group II rice (Oryza sativa) CHD protein CHR729 in nucleosome positioning, gene expression, histone methylation, and binding |  Our data revealed that the chr729 mutation led to increased nucleosome occupancy in the rice genome and altered the expression and histone H3K4me3 modification of many, mainly underexpressed, genes |  Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes |  The results indicate that CHR729 has distinct functions in regulating H3K4me3 and H3K27me3modifications, and gene expression at different chromatin domains and provide insight into chromatin regulation of 'bivalent' genes marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
