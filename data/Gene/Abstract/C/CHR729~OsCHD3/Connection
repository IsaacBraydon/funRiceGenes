CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	OsCLF|SDG711	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele
CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6|RFS	JMJ703|OsJMJ703	A Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-like Binding Factor Functions in Chromatin Modification and Gene Regulation.	 Genetic and genomic analysis revealed that CHR729 and JMJ703, an H3K4 demethylase, had agonistic, antagonistic and independent functions in modulating H3K4me3 and expression of subsets of genes
