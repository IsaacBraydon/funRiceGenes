CHR729|OsCHD3|CRL6	OsCLF|SDG711	Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.	Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele
