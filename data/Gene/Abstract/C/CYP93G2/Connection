CYP93G2	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form
CYP93G2	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta
CYP93G1	CYP93G2	Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.	In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones
