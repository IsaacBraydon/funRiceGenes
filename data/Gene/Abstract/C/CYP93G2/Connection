CYP93G2|qST-6.1	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form
CYP93G2|qST-6.1	OsCGT	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta
CYP93G1|OsFNSII	CYP93G2|qST-6.1	Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.	In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones
CYP93G1|OsFNSII	CYP93G2|qST-6.1	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	 Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield
CYP93G2|qST-6.1	OsF3H03g	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	 Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield
