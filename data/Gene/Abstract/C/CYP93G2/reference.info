Plant Physiol.-2010-Du-324-33.pdf	CYP93G2 is a flavanone 2-hydroxylase required for C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice	2010	Plant Physiol	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.	C-Glycosylflavones are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, and many of them have beneficial effects on human health. They are a special group of flavonoid glycosides in which the sugars are C-linked to the flavone skeleton. It has been long presumed that C-glycosylflavones have a different biosynthetic origin from O-glycosylflavonoids. In rice (Oryza sativa), a C-glucosyltransferase (OsCGT) that accepts 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates and a dehydratase activity that selectively converts C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones to 6C-glucosylflavones were recently described. In this study, we provide in vitro and in planta evidence that the rice P450 CYP93G2 protein encoded by Os06g01250 is a functional flavanone 2-hydroxylase. CYP93G2 is related to the CYP93B subfamily, which consists of dicot flavone synthase II enzymes. In the presence of NADPH, recombinant CYP93G2 converts naringenin and eriodictyol to the corresponding 2-hydroxyflavanones. In addition, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanones, which are modified by O-glycosylation in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Coexpression of CYP93G2 and OsCGT in Arabidopsis resulted in the production of C-glucosyl-2-hydroxyflavanones in the dibenzoylmethane tautomeric form. The same structure was reported previously for the in vitro OsCGT reaction products. Thus, CYP93G2 generates 2-hydroxyflavanone substrates from flavanones for C-glucosylation by OsCGT in planta. Furthermore, knocking down Os06g01250 in rice (O. sativa subsp. japonica 'Zhonghua 11') preferentially depleted the accumulation of C-glycosylapigenin, C-glycosylluteolin, and C-glycosylchrysoeriol but did not affect the levels of tricin, which is frequently present as O-glycosides in cereals. Taken together, our work conclusively assigned CYP93G2 as the first enzyme that channels flavanones to C-glycosylflavone biosynthesis in rice.
NA	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	2020	J Exp Bot	School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China.	Flavonoids are essential for male fertility in some but not all plant species. In rice, the chalcone synthase mutant oschs1 produces flavonoid-depleted pollens and is male sterile. The mutant pollens are viable with normal structure but they displayed reduced germination rate and pollen tube length. Analysis of pollens of oschs1/+ heterozygous lines showed that pollen flavonoid deposition is a paternal effect and fertility is independent from the haploid genotypes (OsCHS1 or oschs1). To understand which classes of flavonoids are involved in male fertility, we further analyzed rice mutants for branch-point enzymes of the downstream flavonoid pathways, including flavanone 3-hydroxylase (OsF3H; flavonol pathway entry enzyme), flavone synthase II (CYP93G1; flavone pathway entry enzyme) and flavanone 2-hydroxylase (CYP93G2; flavone C-glycoside pathway entry enzyme). Rice osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 CRISPR/Cas9 mutants, and cyp93g1 and cyp93g2 T-DNA insertional mutants showed altered flavonoid profiles in anthers but only osf3h and cyp93g1 cyp93g2 mutants displayed reduction in seed yield. Our findings indicated that flavonoids are essential for complete male fertility in rice and a combination of different classes (flavanones, flavonols, flavones, and flavone C-glycosides) are likely to be important, as opposed to the essential role played primarily by flavonols as reported previously in several plant species.
