COPT5	shoot	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice	Zn deficiency induced COPT1, COPT5, and COPT7 and slightly suppressed COPT4 in root and induced COPT5, COPT6, and COPT7 in shoot.
COPT5	resistance	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice.	 Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription
