COPT1	COPT5	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice	However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport
COPT1	COPT5	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice	Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5
COPT1	COPT5	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice.	 Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription
