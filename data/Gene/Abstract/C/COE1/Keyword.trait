COE1	brassinosteroid	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane
COE1	brassinosteroid	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
COE1	brassinosteroid	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	Brassinolide, an active brassinosteroid, decreased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, and brassinazole, an inhibitor of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, increased the CV intervals of wild-type rice, but coe1 mutants showed insensitivity to these chemicals
COE1	brassinosteroid	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals
COE1	auxin	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	These results suggest that auxin and brassinosteroids regulate CV intervals in opposite directions, and COE1 may regulate CV intervals downstream of auxin and brassinosteroid signals
