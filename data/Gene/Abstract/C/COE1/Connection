COE1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	COE1 encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, whose amino acid sequence is similar to that of brassinosteroid-insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1), and which is localized at the plasma membrane
COE1	OsBISERK1|OsSERK1|OsBAK1	COE1, an LRR-RLK responsible for commissural vein pattern formation in rice	Because of the sequence similarity of COE1 to BAK1, we also examined the involvement of brassinosteroids in CV formation
