OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	pollen	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	The mutant exhibits the defects in cell elongation and pollen germination, which can be complemented by the wild type OsCYP96B4 and be rescued by remobilization of the Ds element with the presence of the transposase Activator (Ac)
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	height	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	The oscyp96b4 mutant phenotype could not be rescued by all the tested phytohormones and it was found that OsCYP96B4 reduced plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	height	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	dwarf	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report a novel semi-dwarf rice mutant, in which a single copy of transposon dissociator (Ds) was inserted into the gene OsCYP96B4 (Oryza sativa Cytochrome P450 96B4)
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	dwarf	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oscyp96b4 mutant is a novel rice semi-dwarf mutant
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	phytohormone	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	The oscyp96b4 mutant phenotype could not be rescued by all the tested phytohormones and it was found that OsCYP96B4 reduced plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	cell elongation	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	The mutant exhibits the defects in cell elongation and pollen germination, which can be complemented by the wild type OsCYP96B4 and be rescued by remobilization of the Ds element with the presence of the transposase Activator (Ac)
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	cell elongation	Oryza sativa cytochrome P450 family member OsCYP96B4 reduces plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner	Our data suggest that OsCYP96B4 might be involved in lipid metabolism and regulate cell elongation
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	cell wall	BRITTLE SHEATH1 encoding OsCYP96B4 is involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice.	BRITTLE SHEATH1 encoding OsCYP96B4 is involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice.
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	development	Systems Metabolic Alteration in a Semi-Dwarf Rice Mutant Induced by OsCYP96B4 Gene Mutation.	 The present study will provide essential information for the OsCYP96B4 gene function analysis and may serve as valuable reference data for the development of new semi-dwarf mutants
OsCYP96B4|BSH1|SD37|OsDSS1	map-based cloning	Curled Flag Leaf 2, Encoding a Cytochrome P450 Protein, Regulated by the Transcription Factor Roc5, Influences Flag Leaf Development in Rice	 Map-based cloning reveals that CFL2 encodes a cytochrome P450 protein and corresponds to the previously reported OsCYP96B4
