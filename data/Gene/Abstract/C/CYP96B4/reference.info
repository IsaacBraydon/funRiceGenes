BACKGROUND: Plant cytochromes P450 are involved in a wide range of biosynthetic reactions and play various roles in plant development. However, little is known about the biological functions of the subfamily CYP96 in plants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report a novel semi-dwarf rice mutant, in which a single copy of transposon dissociator (Ds) was inserted into the gene OsCYP96B4 (Oryza sativa Cytochrome P450 96B4). The mutant exhibits the defects in cell elongation and pollen germination, which can be complemented by the wild type OsCYP96B4 and be rescued by remobilization of the Ds element with the presence of the transposase Activator (Ac). Transgenic plants harboring OsCYP96B4 double-stranded RNA interference construct mimicked the mutant phenotype. The oscyp96b4 mutant phenotype could not be rescued by all the tested phytohormones and it was found that OsCYP96B4 reduced plant height in a transcript dosage dependent manner. Heterologous expression of OsCYP96B4 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe resulted in missegregation and wider cells. Further investigation showed that the mutant exhibited the defects in the metabolism of some lipid molecular species when compared with the wild type. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oscyp96b4 mutant is a novel rice semi-dwarf mutant. Our data suggest that OsCYP96B4 might be involved in lipid metabolism and regulate cell elongation.
pone.0088068.pdf	The rice semi-dwarf mutant sd37, caused by a mutation in CYP96B4, plays an important role in the fine-tuning of plant growth	2014	PLoS One	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China ; National Engineering Research Center for Vegetables, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Key Laboratory of Biology and Genetic Improvement of Horticultural Crops (North China), Beijing, China.	Plant cytochrome P450 has diverse roles in developmental processes and in the response to environmental cues. Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa L ssp. indica cultivar 3037) semi-dwarf mutant sd37, in which the gene CYP96B4 (Cytochrome P450 96B subfamily) was identified and confirmed as the target by map-based cloning and a complementation test. A point mutation in the SRS2 domain of CYP96B4 resulted in a threonine to lysine substitution in the sd37 mutant. Examination of the subcellular localization of the protein revealed that SD37 was ER-localized protein. And SD37 was predominantly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and developing leaf and root maturation zone but not in the root apical meristem. The sd37 leaves, panicles, and seeds were smaller than those of the wild type. Histological analysis further revealed that a decrease in cell number in the mutant, specifically in the shoots, was the main cause of the dwarf phenotype. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of several cell division-related genes was disturbed in the sd37 mutant. In addition, mutation or strongly overexpression of SD37 results in dwarf plants but moderate overexpression increases plant height. These data suggest that CYP96B4 may be an important regulator of plant growth that affects plant height in rice.
NA	BRITTLE SHEATH1 encoding OsCYP96B4 is involved in secondary cell wall formation in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Rep	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Mutation of BSH1 leads to brittle sheath phenotype and reduction of very-long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives in wax. The cell wall plays an important role in plant mechanical strength. Several brittle culm mutants have been identified and characterized in rice. Here, we characterized an anther culture-derived rice brittle sheath mutant, named bsh1 and isolated BSH1 via map-based strategy. BSH1 encodes OsCYP96B4 protein, which was localized on ER membrane in the protoplast transient assay. BSH1 is mainly expressed in developing vascular tissues and the cells in which cell wall secondary thickening is occurring. Mutation in bsh1 causes changes in cell wall composition by affecting the expression of cell wall-related genes. Moreover, bsh1 shows reduced amounts of very-long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives in wax rather than the medium-chain fatty acids. In summary, BSH1 functions mainly in secondary cell wall formation, and probably in wax biosynthesis in an unidentified mechanism.
NA	Systems Metabolic Alteration in a Semi-Dwarf Rice Mutant Induced by OsCYP96B4 Gene Mutation.	2020	Int J Mol Sci	Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MOE Key Lab of Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan 430030, China.	Dwarfism and semi-dwarfism are among the most valuable agronomic traits in crop breeding, which were adopted by the &quot;Green Revolution&quot;. Previously, we reported a novel semi-dwarf rice mutant (oscyp96b4) derived from the insertion of a single copy of Dissociator (Ds) transposon into the gene OsCYP96B4. However, the systems metabolic effect of the mutation is not well understood, which is important for understanding the gene function and developing new semi-dwarf mutants. Here, the metabolic phenotypes in the semi-dwarf mutant (M) and ectopic expression (ECE) rice line were compared to the wild-type (WT) rice, by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Compared with WT, ECE of the OsCYP96B4 gene resulted in significant increase of ¦Ã-aminobutyrate (GABA), glutamine, and alanine, but significant decrease of glutamate, aromatic and branched-chain amino acids, and some other amino acids. The ECE caused significant increase of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), but significant decrease of disaccharide (sucrose); induced significant changes of metabolites involved in choline metabolism (phosphocholine, ethanolamine) and nucleotide metabolism (adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, uridine). These metabolic profile alterations were accompanied with changes in the gene expression levels of some related enzymes, involved in GABA shunt, glutamate and glutamine metabolism, choline metabolism, sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, nucleotide metabolism, and shikimate-mediated secondary metabolism. The semi-dwarf mutant showed corresponding but less pronounced changes, especially in the gene expression levels. It indicates that OsCYP96B4 gene mutation in rice causes significant alteration in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and shikimate-mediated secondary metabolism. The present study will provide essential information for the OsCYP96B4 gene function analysis and may serve as valuable reference data for the development of new semi-dwarf mutants.
NA	Curled Flag Leaf 2, Encoding a Cytochrome P450 Protein, Regulated by the Transcription Factor Roc5, Influences Flag Leaf Development in Rice	2021	Front Plant Sci	Key Laboratory of Application and Safety Control of Genetically Modified Crops, Rice Research Institute, Southwest University, Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Chongqing, China.	Moderate curling generally causes upright leaf blades, which favors the establishment of ideal plant architecture and increases the photosynthetic efficiency of the population, both of which are desirable traits for super hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we identified a novel curled-leaf mutant, curled flag leaf 2 (cfl2), which shows specific curling at the base of the flag leaf owing to abnormal epidermal development, caused by enlarged bulliform cells and increased number of papillae with the disordered distribution. Map-based cloning reveals that CFL2 encodes a cytochrome P450 protein and corresponds to the previously reported OsCYP96B4. CFL2 was expressed in all analyzed tissues with differential abundance and was downregulated in the clf1 mutant [a mutant harbors a mutation in the homeodomain leucine zipper IV (HD-ZIP IV) transcription factor Roc5]. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays confirm that Roc5 could directly bind to the cis-element L1 box in the promoter of CFL2 before activating CFL2 expression. RNA sequencing reveals that genes associated with cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall-related processes were significantly upregulated in the cfl2 mutant. The components of cell wall, such as lignin, cellulose, and some kinds of monosaccharide, were altered dramatically in the cfl2 mutant when compared with wild-type "Jinhui10" (WT). Taken together, CFL2, as a target gene of Roc5, plays an important role in the regulation of flag leaf shape by influencing epidermis and cell wall development.
