CLPP4|OsClpP4	chloroplast	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	These observations provided further evidence that VYL plays a role in regulating chloroplast biogenesis and that VYL, OsClpP3, and OsClpP4 function together in the chloroplast Clp.
CLPP4|OsClpP4	chloroplast	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	Notably, we found that OsClpPs, OsClpT, and OsClpR4 had similar expression patterns to VYL in wild-type plants, with peak mRNA accumulation at the early stage of chloroplast development.
