CLPP4|OsClpP4	OsClpP5	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	Furthermore, we found that OsClpP3 directly interacts with OsClpT, that OsClpP4 directly interacts with OsClpP5 and OsClpT, and that both OsClpP4 and OsClpT can homodimerize
CLPP4|OsClpP4	VYL|NAL9	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo
CLPP4|OsClpP4	VYL|NAL9	A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants	In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4
CLPP4|OsClpP4	OsClpP5	Plastid caseinolytic protease OsClpR1 regulates chloroplast development and chloroplast RNA editing in rice	 Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that OsClpR1 interacted with OsClpP4, OsClpP5, OsClpP2, and OsClpS1
