CAD8B	OsBZR1|BZR1	Red-light receptor phytochrome B inhibits BZR1-NAC028-CAD8B signaling to negatively regulate rice resistance to sheath blight.	 Yeast-one hybrid, ChIP, and transactivation assays demonstrated that BZR1 and NAC028 activate CAD8B directly
CAD8B	NAC028	bZIP23 interacts with NAC028 to modulate rice resistance to sheath blight disease.	 Results of the transcriptome and qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that CAD8B, a key enzyme for lignin biosynthesis and ShB resistance, is regulated by both bZIP23 and NAC028
CAD8B	NAC028	bZIP23 interacts with NAC028 to modulate rice resistance to sheath blight disease.	 The combination of the yeast-one hybrid, ChIP-qPCR, and transactivation assays illustrated that both bZIP23 and NAC028 directly bind the CAD8B promoter and activate its expression
