Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.
nihms246813.pdf	CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice	2011	Plant J	Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011, USA.	Rice (Oryza sativa) produces momilactone diterpenoids as both phytoalexins and allelochemicals. Strikingly, the rice genome contains a biosynthetic gene cluster for momilactone production, located on rice chromosome 4, which contains two cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock-down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation. Here we attempted biochemical characterization of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, which was ultimately achieved by complete gene recoding, enabling functional recombinant expression in bacteria. With these synthetic gene constructs it was possible to demonstrate that while CYP99A2 does not exhibit significant activity with diterpene substrates, CYP99A3 catalyzes consecutive oxidations of the C19 methyl group of the momilactone precursor syn-pimara-7,15-diene to form, sequentially, syn-pimaradien-19-ol, syn-pimaradien-19-al, and syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid. These are presumably intermediates in momilactone biosynthesis, as a C19 carboxylic acid moiety is required for formation of the core 19,6-gamma-lactone ring structure. We further were able to detect syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid in rice plants, which indicates physiological relevance for the observed activity of CYP99A3. In addition, we found that CYP99A3 also oxidized syn-stemod-13(17)-ene at C19 to produce, sequentially, syn-stemoden-19-ol, syn-stemoden-19-al, and syn-stemoden-19-oic acid, albeit with lower catalytic efficiency than with syn-pimaradiene. Although the CYP99A3 syn-stemodene-derived products were not detected in planta, these results nevertheless provide a hint at the currently unknown metabolic fate of this diterpene in rice. Regardless of any wider role, our results strongly indicate that CYP99A3 acts as a multifunctional diterpene oxidase in momilactone biosynthesis.
