CAP1	grain	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains
CAP1	grain	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
CAP1	cell wall	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate
CAP1	growth	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
CAP1	anther	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage
CAP1	pollen	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (cap1), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa)
CAP1	pollen	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
CAP1	pollen	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage
CAP1	pollen	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate
CAP1	pollen	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
CAP1	vegetative	Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice	 Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
