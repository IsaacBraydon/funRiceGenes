CNGC	signaling pathway gene	Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Coupled with a Critical-Time-Point Analysis during Pathogenesis for Predicting the Molecular Mechanism Underlying Blast Resistance in Rice	PPI was the significant affected pathway in both the pink module and the time-point of 24 hpi. Specially for the 24 hpi, LOC_Os02g41710 (CNGC) was the only MAPK signaling pathway gene that had lower expression in Piz-t-KJ201 as compared with NPB-KJ201.
