COLD1	tolerance	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.	Here, we identify the quantitative trait locus COLD1 that confers chilling tolerance in japonica rice
COLD1	chilling	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.
COLD1	chilling	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.	Here, we identify the quantitative trait locus COLD1 that confers chilling tolerance in japonica rice
COLD1	chilling	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.	We further identify that a SNP in COLD1, SNP2, originated from Chinese Oryza rufipogon, is responsible for the ability of COLD(jap/ind) to confer chilling tolerance, supporting the importance of COLD1 in plant adaptation
COLD1	plasma membrane	COLD1 Confers Chilling Tolerance in Rice.	COLD1 encodes a regulator of G-protein signaling that localizes on plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
