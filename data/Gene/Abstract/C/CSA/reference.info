Plant Cell-2010-Zhang-672-89.pdf	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development	2010	Plant Cell	School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	In flowering plants, sink tissues rely on transport of carbohydrates from photosynthetic tissues (sources) for nutrition and energy. However, how sugar partitioning in plants is regulated at the molecular level during development remains unknown. We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs. In particular, the csa mutant had reduced levels of carbohydrates in later anthers and was male sterile. The csa mutant had reduced accumulation of (14)C-labeled sugars in anther sink tissue. CSA was isolated by map-based cloning and was shown to encode an R2R3 MYB transcription factor that was expressed preferentially in the anther tapetal cells and in the sugar-transporting vascular tissues. In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers. Furthermore, CSA was found to be associated in vivo and in vitro with the promoter of MST8. Our findings suggest that CSA is a key transcriptional regulator for sugar partitioning in rice during male reproductive development. This study also establishes a molecular model system for further elucidation of the genetic control of carbon partitioning in plants.
PNAS-2012-Zhang-1213041110.pdf	Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production	2013	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.	Rice is a major staple food worldwide. Making hybrid rice has proved to be an effective strategy to significantly increase grain yield. Current hybrid rice technologies rely on male sterile lines and have been used predominantly in indica cultivars. However, intrinsic problems exist in the implementation of these technologies, such as limited germplasms and unpredictable conversions from sterility to fertility in the field. Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development. This mutation was introduced into indica and japonica rice, and it rendered male sterility under short-day conditions and male fertility under long-day conditions in both lines. Furthermore, F(1) plants of csa and a restorer line JP69 exhibited heterosis (hybrid vigor), suggesting the feasibility of using this mutation to create hybrid rice. The csa-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture.
NA	Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein.	2015	Plant J	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic &amp; Developmental Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University-University of Adelaide Joint Centre for Agriculture and Health, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Transport of photoassimilates from leaf tissues (source regions) to the sink organs is essential for plant development. Here, we show that a phytohormone, the brassinosteroids (BRs) promotes pollen and seed development in rice by directly promoting expression of Carbon Starved Anther (CSA) which encodes a MYB domain protein. Over-expression of the BR-synthesis gene D11 or a BR-signaling factor OsBZR1 results in higher sugar accumulation in developing anthers and seeds, as well as higher grain yield compared with control non-transgenic plants. Conversely, knockdown of D11 or OsBZR1 expression causes defective pollen maturation and reduced seed size and weight, with less accumulation of starch in comparison with the control. Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development. These findings provide insight into how BRs enhance plant reproduction and grain yield in an important agricultural crop. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
NA	Dynamic genome-wide association analysis and identification of candidate genes involved in anaerobic germination tolerance in rice	2021	Rice (N Y)	National Engineering Research Center of Plant Space Breeding, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, 510642, China.	Background: In Asian rice production, an increasing number of countries now choose the direct seeding mode because of rising costs, labour shortages and water shortages. The ability of rice seeds to undergo anaerobic germination (AG) plays an important role in the success of direct seeding.  Results: In this study, we used 2,123,725 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers based on resequencing to conduct a dynamic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of coleoptile length (CL) and coleoptile diameter (CD) in 209 natural rice populations. A total of 26 SNP loci were detected in these two phenotypes, of which 5 overlapped with previously reported loci (S1_ 39674301, S6_ 20797781, S7_ 18722403, S8_ 9946213, S11_ 19165397), and two sites were detected repeatedly at different time points (S3_ 24689629 and S5_ 27918754). We suggest that these 7 loci (-log10 (P) value > 7.3271) are the key sites that affect AG tolerance. To screen the candidate genes more effectively, we sequenced the transcriptome of the flooding-tolerant variety R151 in six key stages, including anaerobic (AN) and the oxygen conversion point (AN-A), and obtained high-quality differential expression profiles. Four reliable candidate genes were identified: Os01g0911700 (OsVP1), Os05g0560900 (OsGA2ox8), Os05g0562200 (OsDi19-1) and Os06g0548200. Then qRT-PCR and LC-MS/ MS targeting metabolite detection technology were used to further verify that the up-regulated expression of these four candidate genes was closely related to AG.  Conclusion: The four novel candidate genes were associated with gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) regulation and cell wall metabolism under oxygen-deficiency conditions and promoted coleoptile elongation while avoiding adverse effects, allowing the coleoptile to obtain oxygen, escape the low-oxygen environment and germinate rapidly. The results of this study improve our understanding of the genetic basis of AG in rice seeds, which is conducive to the selection of flooding-tolerant varieties suitable for direct seeding.
NA	The regulatory role of CARBON STARVED ANTHER-mediated photoperiod-dependent male fertility in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Joint International Research Laboratory of Metabolic and Developmental Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.	Environmental signals, especially daylength, play important roles in determining fertility in photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile (PGMS) lines that are critical to sustain production of high-yielding hybrid rice (Oryza sativa) varieties. However, the mechanisms by which PGMS lines perceive changes in photoperiod and transmit those signals to elicit downstream effects are not well understood. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes from the leaves and anthers of carbon starved anther (csa), a PGMS line, to wild-type (WT) tissues under different photoperiods. Components of circadian clock in the leaves, including Circadian Clock-Associated 1 and Pseudo-Response Regulator (PRR95), played vital roles in sensing the photoperiod signals. Photoperiod signals were weakly transduced to anthers, where gene expression was mainly controlled by the CSA allele. CSA played a critical role in regulating sugar metabolism and cell wall synthesis in anthers under short-day conditions, and transcription of key genes inducing csa-directed sterility was upregulated under long-day (LD) conditions though not to WT levels, revealing a mechanism to explain the partial restoration of fertility in rice under LD conditions. Eight direct targets of CSA regulation were identified, all of which were genes involved in sugar metabolism and transport (cell wall invertases, SWEETs, and monosaccharide transporters) expressed only in reproductive tissues. Several hub genes coordinating the effects of CSA regulation were identified as critical elements determining WT male fertility and further analysis of these and related genes will reveal insights into how CSA coordinates sugar metabolism, cell wall biosynthesis, and photoperiod sensing in rice anther development.
