CSA	Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein. |  Here, we show that a phytohormone, the brassinosteroids (BRs) promotes pollen and seed development in rice by directly promoting expression of Carbon Starved Anther (CSA) which encodes a MYB domain protein |  Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
CSA	 Photoperiod signals were weakly transduced to anthers, where gene expression was mainly controlled by the CSA allele
