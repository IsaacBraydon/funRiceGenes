CSA	OsMST8	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development	In addition, the expression of MST8, encoding a monosaccharide transporter, was greatly reduced in csa anthers
CSA	OsMST8	Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development	Furthermore, CSA was found to be associated in vivo and in vitro with the promoter of MST8
CSA	OsBZR1	Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein.	Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
