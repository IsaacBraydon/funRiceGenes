CAL2	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants. |  CAL2 shared 66% similarity with CAL1, and its mRNA accumulation is mainly observed in roots and is unaffected by Cd stress, but its transcription level was lower than that of CAL1 based on the relative expression of CAL2/Actin1 observed in this study and that reported previously |  Stable expression of the CAL2-mRFP fusion protein indicated that CAL2 is also localized in the cell walls |  Overexpression of CAL2 increased Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis and rice shoots, but it had no effect on the accumulation of other essential elements |  Heterologous expression of CAL2 enhanced Cd sensitivity in Arabidopsis, whereas overexpression of CAL2 had no effect on Cd tolerance in rice |  These findings indicate that CAL2 positively regulates Cd accumulation in ectopic overexpression lines of Arabidopsis and rice	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants. |  Overexpression of CAL2 increased Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis and rice shoots, but it had no effect on the accumulation of other essential elements |  Heterologous expression of CAL2 enhanced Cd sensitivity in Arabidopsis, whereas overexpression of CAL2 had no effect on Cd tolerance in rice |  These findings indicate that CAL2 positively regulates Cd accumulation in ectopic overexpression lines of Arabidopsis and rice
