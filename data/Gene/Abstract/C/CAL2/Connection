CAL2	OsDEF7|CAL1|OsAFP1	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	 CAL2 shared 66% similarity with CAL1, and its mRNA accumulation is mainly observed in roots and is unaffected by Cd stress, but its transcription level was lower than that of CAL1 based on the relative expression of CAL2/Actin1 observed in this study and that reported previously
