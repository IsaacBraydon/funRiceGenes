CAL2	root	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	 A promoter-GUS assay revealed that CAL2 is expressed in root tips
CAL2	tolerance	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	 Heterologous expression of CAL2 enhanced Cd sensitivity in Arabidopsis, whereas overexpression of CAL2 had no effect on Cd tolerance in rice
CAL2	cell wall	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	 Stable expression of the CAL2-mRFP fusion protein indicated that CAL2 is also localized in the cell walls
CAL2	cadmium	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.
CAL2	cadmium accumulation	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.	Overexpression of a Defensin-Like Gene CAL2 Enhances Cadmium Accumulation in Plants.
