CRD1	stem	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 CRD1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in the crown root primordium at the stem base
CRD1	root	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 CRD1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in the crown root primordium at the stem base
CRD1	root	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 The altered crown root phenotype of crd1 was simulated by target mimicry of miR156, suggesting that this defect is due to the disruption of miR156 regulatory pathways
CRD1	cytoplasm	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 The crd1 mutant contains significantly reduced miRNA levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that CRD1 is essential for maintaining normal miRNA levels in plant cells
CRD1	crown	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 CRD1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in the crown root primordium at the stem base
CRD1	crown	CRD1, an Xpo1 domain protein, regulates miRNA accumulation and crown root development in rice.	 The altered crown root phenotype of crd1 was simulated by target mimicry of miR156, suggesting that this defect is due to the disruption of miR156 regulatory pathways
