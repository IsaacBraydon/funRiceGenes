The orderly deposition of secondary cell wall (SCW) in plants is implicated in various biological programs and is precisely controlled. Although many positive and negative regulators of SCW have been documented, the molecular mechanisms underlying SCW formation coordinated with distinct cellular physiological processes during plant adaptive growth remain largely unclear. Here, we report the identification of Cellulose Synthase co-expressed Kinase1 (CSK1), which encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, as a negative regulator of SCW formation and its signaling cascade in rice. Transcriptome deep sequencing of developing internodes and genome-wide co-expression assays revealed that CSK1 is co-expressed with cellulose synthase genes and is responsive to various stress stimuli. The increased SCW thickness and vigorous vessel transport in csk1 indicate that CSK1 functions as a negative regulator of SCW biosynthesis. Through observation of green fluorescent protein-tagged CSK1 in rice protoplasts and stable transgenic plants, we found that CSK1 is localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm adjacent to the plasma membrane. Biochemical and molecular assays demonstrated that CSK1 phosphorylates VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 6 (VND6), a master SCW-associated transcription factor, in the nucleus, which reduces the transcription of a suite of SCW-related genes, thereby attenuating SCW accumulation. Consistently, genetic analyses show that CSK1 functions upstream of VND6 in regulating SCW formation. Interestingly, our physiological analyses revealed that CSK1 and VND6 are involved in abscisic acid-mediated regulation of cell growth and SCW deposition. Taken together, these results indicate that the CSK1-VND6 module is an important component of the SCW biosynthesis machinery, which coordinates SCW accumulation and adaptive growth in rice. Our study not only identifies a new regulator of SCW biosynthesis but also reveals a fine-tuned mechanism for precise control of SCW deposition, offering tools for rationally tailoring agronomic traits.
