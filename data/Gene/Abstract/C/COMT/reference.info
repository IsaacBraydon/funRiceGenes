Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) catalyzes the last step of monolignol biosynthesis. The rice genome contains 12 CAD-like genes, and whereas the proteins encoded by OsCAD2 and OsCAD7 are known to function in monolignol biosynthesis, the degree to which these enzymes contribute to this process and the involvement of the enzymes encoded by the remaining ten genes is unclear. This paper investigates the role of OsCAD2 and the nine other OsCAD-like proteins in monolignol biosynthesis. Among the OsCAD genes analyzed, OsCAD2, an enzyme belonging to the bona fide CAD phylogenetic group, was the most abundantly expressed gene in the uppermost internode, and was expressed at levels that were more than seven times greater than those of the second most abundantly expressed gene, OsCAD1. Promoter-GUS analysis of OsCAD2 (pCAD::GUS) in the internode, sheath, and roots revealed that GUS expression was strong in tissues that accumulated high levels of lignin. Furthermore, expression always preceded lignin accumulation, showing the tight correlation between OsCAD2 expression and monolignol biosynthesis. Additionally, expression of pCAD::GUS was well synchronized with that of rice caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT::GUS), suggesting that the two enzymes function cooperatively during monolignol biosynthesis. Co-expression network analysis of eight OsCAD genes further revealed that, among the OsCAD genes, expression of OsCAD2 was most tightly associated with the transcription of lignin biosynthesis-related genes. These results suggest that OsCAD2 is largely responsible for monolignol biosynthesis in rice, which is similar to that indicated for the predominant role of other plant bona fide CAD protein to monolignol biosynthesis.
Kim-2006-Flavonoid 3'-O-methy.pdf	Flavonoid 3'-O-methyltransferase from rice: cDNA cloning, characterization and functional expression	2006	Phytochemistry	Bio/Molecular Informatics Center, Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Konkuk University, 1 Hwayang-dong, Kwangjin-gu, Seoul 143-701, Republic of Korea.	Plant O-methyltransferases (OMTs) are known to be involved in methylation of plant secondary metabolites, especially phenylpropanoid and flavonoid compounds. An OMT, ROMT-9, was cloned and characterized from rice using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The blast results for ROMT-9 showed a 73% identity with caffeic acid OMTs from maize and Triticum aestivum. ROMT-9 was expressed in Escherichia coli and its recombinant protein was purified using affinity chromatography. It was then tested for its ability to transfer the methyl group of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to the flavonoid substrates, eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin, and taxifolin, all of which have a 3'-hydroxyl functional group. The reaction products were analyzed using TLC, HPLC, HPLC/MS, and NMR spectroscopy. The NMR analysis showed that ROMT-9 transferred the methyl group specifically to the 3'-hydroxyl group of quercetin, resulting in the formation of its methoxy derivative. Furthermore, ROMT-9 converted flavonoids containing the 3'-hydroxy functional group such as eriodictyol, luteolin, quercetin and taxifolin into the corresponding methoxy derivatives, suggesting that ROMT-9 is an OMT with strict specificity for the 3'-hydroxy group of flavonoids.
Lin-2008-Proteomic analysis o.pdf	Proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole	2008	Phytochemistry	Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica, 128, Sec. 2, Academia Road, Taipei 11529, Taiwan.	Here, we report the first proteomic analysis of rice defense response induced by probenazole (PBZ), an agricultural chemical that has been widely used to protect rice plants from rice blast and the bacterial blight pathogen. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was utilized to identify a total of 40 protein spots including 9 protein spots that are up-regulated by PBZ and 31 abundant protein spots. A total of 11 unique proteins from these 9 spots were identified by LC-MS/MS, and the majority of them were classified and/or possessed orthologs in defense-related functions. Five protein spots with only one protein species identified in each spot appear to be PBZ-regulated proteins. They are a putative glutathione S-transferase GSTU17, a putative phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, XP_466843), a putative caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a putative NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a putative glucose-1-phosphate adenyltransferase. However, the other six protein species identified from the remaining four protein spots could not be conclusively described as PBZ-regulated proteins due to either the co-migration of two protein species in one spot or the presence of one protein species in two spots. Through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), it was determined that PAL (XP_466843) is likely regulated at the protein level, whereas GSTU17 and COMT were regulated at the mRNA level after PBZ application. Interestingly, the mRNA transcripts of two PAL paralogs were found to be up-regulated by PBZ. We propose that PAL, COMT, and GSTU17 are likely to confer PBZ-induced disease resistance via such functions as biosynthesis and transport of flavonoid-type phytoalexin and/or lignin biogenesis.
NA	Melatonin biosynthesis requires N-acetylserotonin methyltransferase activity of caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in rice.	2015	J Exp Bot	Department of Biotechnology, Bioenergy Research Center, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea.	Caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) methylates N-acetylserotonin into melatonin; that is, it has N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT) activity. The ASMT activity of COMT was first detected in Arabidopsis thaliana COMT (AtCOMT). To confirm the involvement of COMT on melatonin synthesis in other plant species, the ASMT activity of a COMT from rice (Oryza sativa) (OsCOMT) was evaluated. Purified recombinant OsCOMT protein from Escherichia coli was used to validate the high ASMT activity of OsCOMT, similar to that of AtCOMT. The K m and V max values for the ASMT activity of OsCOMT were 243 µM and 2400 pmol min(-1) mg protein(-1), which were similar to those of AtCOMT. Similar to AtCOMT, OsCOMT was localized in the cytoplasm. In vitro ASMT activity was significantly inhibited by either caffeic acid or quercetin in a dose-dependent manner. Analogously, in vivo production of melatonin was significantly inhibited by quercetin in 4-week-old detached rice leaves. Lastly, the transgenic rice plants overexpressing rice COMT showed an increase in melatonin levels whereas transgenic rice plants suppressing the rice COMT had a significant decrease on melatonin levels, suggestive of the direct role of COMT in melatonin biosynthesis in plants.
NA	OsCAldOMT1 is a bifunctional O-methyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls.	2019	Sci Rep	Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere, Kyoto University, Gokasho, Uji, Kyoto, 611-0011, Japan.	Lignin is a phenylpropanoid polymer produced in the secondary cell walls of vascular plants. Although most eudicot and gymnosperm species generate lignins solely via polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (monolignols), grasses additionally use a flavone, tricin, as a natural lignin monomer to generate tricin-incorporated lignin polymers in cell walls. We previously found that disruption of a rice 5-HYDROXYCONIFERALDEHYDE O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (OsCAldOMT1) reduced extractable tricin-type metabolites in rice vegetative tissues. This same enzyme has also been implicated in the biosynthesis of sinapyl alcohol, a monolignol that constitutes syringyl lignin polymer units. Here, we further demonstrate through in-depth cell wall structural analyses that OsCAldOMT1-deficient rice plants produce altered lignins largely depleted in both syringyl and tricin units. We also show that recombinant OsCAldOMT1 displayed comparable substrate specificities towards both 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde and selgin intermediates in the monolignol and tricin biosynthetic pathways, respectively. These data establish OsCAldOMT1 as a bifunctional O-methyltransferase predominantly involved in the two parallel metabolic pathways both dedicated to the biosynthesis of tricin-lignins in rice cell walls. Given that cell wall digestibility was greatly enhanced in the OsCAldOMT1-deficient rice plants, genetic manipulation of CAldOMTs conserved in grasses may serve as a potent strategy to improve biorefinery applications of grass biomass.
NA	OsCOMT, encoding a caffeic acid O-methyltransferase in melatonin biosynthesis, increases rice grain yield through dual regulation of leaf senescence and vascular development.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics of the Ministry of Education, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Agricultural College of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.	Melatonin, a natural phytohormone in plants, plays multiple critical roles in plant growth and stress responses. Although melatonin biosynthesis-related genes have been suggested to possess diverse biological functions, their roles and functional mechanisms in regulating rice grain yield remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncovered the roles of a caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (OsCOMT) gene in mediating rice grain yield through dual regulation of leaf senescence and vascular development. In vitro and in vivo evidence revealed that OsCOMT is involved in melatonin biosynthesis. Transgenic assays suggested that OsCOMT significantly delays leaf senescence at the grain filling stage by inhibiting degradation of chlorophyll and chloroplast, which, in turn, improves photosynthesis efficiency. In addition, the number and size of vascular bundles in the culms and leaves were significantly increased in the OsCOMT-overexpressing plants, while decreased in the knockout plants, suggesting that OsCOMT plays a positive role in vascular development of rice. Further evidence indicated that OsCOMT-mediated vascular development might owe to the crosstalk between melatonin and cytokinin. More importantly, we found that OsCOMT is a positive regulator of grain yield, and overexpression of OsCOMT increase grain yield per plant even in a high-yield variety background, suggesting that OsCOMT can be used as an important target for enhancing rice yield. Our findings shed novel insights into melatonin-mediated leaf senescence and vascular development and provide a possible strategy for genetic improvement of rice grain yield.
NA	Genetic modification of flavone biosynthesis in rice enhances biofilm formation of soil diazotrophic bacteria and biological nitrogen fixation.	2022	Plant Biotechnol J	Department of Plant Sciences, University of California, Davis, California, USA.	Improving biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in cereal crops is a long-sought objective; however, no successful modification of cereal crops showing increased BNF has been reported. Here, we described a novel approach in which rice plants were modified to increase the production of compounds that stimulated biofilm formation in soil diazotrophic bacteria, promoted bacterial colonization of plant tissues and improved BNF with increased grain yield at limiting soil nitrogen contents. We first used a chemical screening to identify plant-produced compounds that induced biofilm formation in nitrogen-fixing bacteria and demonstrated that apigenin and other flavones induced BNF. We then used CRISPR-based gene editing targeting apigenin breakdown in rice, increasing plant apigenin contents and apigenin root exudation. When grown at limiting soil nitrogen conditions, modified rice plants displayed increased grain yield. Biofilm production also modified the root microbiome structure, favouring the enrichment of diazotrophic bacteria recruitment. Our results support the manipulation of the flavone biosynthetic pathway as a feasible strategy for the induction of biological nitrogen fixation in cereals and a reduction in the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers.
