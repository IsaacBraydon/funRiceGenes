COMT|OsCOMT|OsCAldOMT1|ROMT9	GH2|OsCAD2	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 A set of rice mutants harboring knockout mutations in either or both OsCAldOMT1 and OsCAD2 was generated in part by genome editing and subjected to comparative cell wall chemical and supramolecular structure analyses
COMT|OsCOMT|OsCAldOMT1|ROMT9	GH2|OsCAD2	Lignocellulose molecular assembly and deconstruction properties of lignin-altered rice mutants.	 Further, OsCAldOMT1 deficiency contributed to the increase of the cellulose molecular mobility more prominently than OsCAD2 deficiency, resulting in apparently more loosened lignocellulose molecular assembly
