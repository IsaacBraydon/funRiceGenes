Four of the six T0 plants had single copies of complete T-DNAs, while the other two had complex integration patterns. Three of the four single-copy lines showed a 3:1 segregation ratio in the T1 generation. Northern and western blot analyses of T1 plants revealed constitutive expression of chitinase and Î²-1,3-glucanase genes. Homozygous T2 plants of the single-copy lines CG20, CG27 and CG53 showed 62-, 9.6- and 11-fold higher chitinase activity over the control plants. Î²-1,3-Glucanase activity was 1.1- to 2.5-fold higher in the transgenic plants. Bioassay of homozygous T2 plants of the three single-copy transgenic lines against Rhizoctonia solani revealed a 60% reduction in sheath blight Disease Index in the first week. The Disease Index increased from 61.8 in the first week to 90.6 in the third week in control plants, while it remained low (26.8â€<U+393C><U+3E33>34.2) in the transgenic T3 plants in the corresponding period, reflecting the persistence of sheath blight resistance for a longer period.
