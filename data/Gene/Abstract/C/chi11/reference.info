Four of the six T0 plants had single copies of complete T-DNAs, while the other two had complex integration patterns. Three of the four single-copy lines showed a 3:1 segregation ratio in the T1 generation. Northern and western blot analyses of T1 plants revealed constitutive expression of chitinase and Î²-1,3-glucanase genes. Homozygous T2 plants of the single-copy lines CG20, CG27 and CG53 showed 62-, 9.6- and 11-fold higher chitinase activity over the control plants. Î²-1,3-Glucanase activity was 1.1- to 2.5-fold higher in the transgenic plants. Bioassay of homozygous T2 plants of the three single-copy transgenic lines against Rhizoctonia solani revealed a 60% reduction in sheath blight Disease Index in the first week. The Disease Index increased from 61.8 in the first week to 90.6 in the third week in control plants, while it remained low (26.8â€<U+393C><U+3E33>34.2) in the transgenic T3 plants in the corresponding period, reflecting the persistence of sheath blight resistance for a longer period.
NA	Dual gene expression cassette is superior than single gene cassette for enhancing sheath blight tolerance in transgenic rice.	2017	Sci Rep	Laboratory of Translational Research on Transgenic Crops, Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata, 700019, West Bengal, India.	Sheath blight, caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani, is a serious and destructive disease of the rice. In order to improve sheath blight resistance, we developed three different kinds of transgenic rice lines. The first transgenic line overexpresses the rice chitinase gene (OsCHI11); the second contains the Arabidopsis NPR1 (AtNPR1) gene and, the third has pyramided constructs with both the genes (OsCHI11 and AtNPR1). This is a comparative study between the single-gene transgenic lines and the double gene transgenic in terms of their ability to activate the plant defense system. Rice plants of each individual construct were screened via PCR, Southern hybridization, activity assays, and expression analysis. The best transgenic lines of each construct were chosen for comparative study. The fold change in qRT-PCR and activity assays revealed that the pyramided transgenic rice plants show a significant upregulation of defense-related genes, PR genes, and antioxidant marker genes as compared to the single transgene. Simultaneous co-expression of both the genes was found to be more efficient in tolerating oxidative stress. In R. solani (RS) toxin assay, mycelial agar disc bioassay, and in vivo plant bioassay, pyramided transgenic plant lines were more competent at restricting the pathogen development and enhancing sheath blight tolerance as compared to single gene transformants.
