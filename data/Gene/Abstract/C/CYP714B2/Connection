CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Moreover, the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were decreased, whereas those of 13-H GAs including GA(4) (which is more active than GA(1)) were increased, in the rice cyp714b1 cyp714b2 double mutant
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Moreover, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 expression was up-regulated by exogenous application of bioactive GAs
CYP714B1	CYP714B2	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice
