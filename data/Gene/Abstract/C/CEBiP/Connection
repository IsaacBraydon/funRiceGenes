CEBiP|OsCEBiP	LYP4|OsLYP4	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	LYP6|OsLYP6	OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction	Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	A plasma membrane glycoprotein, CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) and a receptor kinase, CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase) (also known as LysM-RLK1), were identified as critical components for chitin signaling in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	We report here that rice cells require a LysM receptor-like kinase, OsCERK1, in addition to CEBiP, for chitin signaling
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	The results of a yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that both CEBiP and OsCERK1 have the potential to form hetero- or homo-oligomers
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	Immunoprecipitation using a membrane preparation from rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharides suggested the ligand-induced formation of a receptor complex containing both CEBiP and OsCERK1
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice	Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity	OsCERK1 associated with OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when induced by PGN but it associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6, or CEBiP under chitin treatment, suggesting the presence of different patterns of ligand-induced heterooligomeric receptor complexes.
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	The bifunctional plant receptor, OsCERK1, regulates both chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.	On the other hand, a KO mutant of OsCEBiP, which forms a receptor complex with OsCERK1 and is essential for chitin-triggered immunity, established mycorrhizal symbiosis normally
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsRacGEF1	An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.	Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity
CEBiP|OsCEBiP	OsCERK1	The rice LysM receptor-like kinase OsCERK1 is required for the perception of short-chain chitin oligomers in arbuscular mycorrhizal signaling.	 By contrast, rice lines mutated in OsCEBiP, encoding the LysM receptor-like protein which associates with OsCERK1 to perceive chitin elicitors of the host immune defense pathway, responded positively to Myc-COs
