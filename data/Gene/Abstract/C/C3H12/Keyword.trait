C3H12	jasmonic	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
C3H12	 xoo 	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 These results suggest that C3H12, as a nucleic acid-binding protein, positively and quantitatively regulates rice resistance to Xoo and that its function is likely associated with the JA-dependent pathway
C3H12	disease resistance	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12
C3H12	disease	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 C3H12 colocalized with a minor disease resistance quantitative trait locus to Xoo, and the enhanced resistance of randomly chosen plants in the quantitative trait locus mapping population correlated with an increased expression level of C3H12
C3H12	 ja 	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
C3H12	 ja 	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 In contrast, knockout or suppression of C3H12 resulted in partially increased susceptibility to Xoo, accompanied by decreased levels of JA and expression of JA signaling genes in rice
C3H12	jasmonic acid	A CCCH-type zinc finger nucleic acid-binding protein quantitatively confers resistance against rice bacterial blight disease	 Activation of C3H12 partially enhanced resistance to Xoo, accompanied by the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and induced expression of JA signaling genes in rice
