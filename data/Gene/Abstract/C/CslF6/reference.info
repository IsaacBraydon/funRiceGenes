Plant Physiol.-2012-Vega-Sanchez-pp.112.195495.pdf	Loss of Cellulose synthase-like F6 function affects mixed-linkage glucan deposition, cell wall mechanical properties, and defense responses in vegetative tissues of rice	2012	Plant Physiol	Joint BioEnergy Institute, Emeryville, California 94608, USA.	Mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) is a cell wall polysaccharide containing a backbone of unbranched (1,3)- and (1,4)-linked beta-glucosyl residues. Based on its occurrence in plants and chemical characteristics, MLG has primarily been associated with the regulation of cell wall expansion due to its high and transient accumulation in young, expanding tissues. The Cellulose synthase-like F (CslF) subfamily of glycosyltransferases has previously been implicated in mediating the biosynthesis of this polymer. We confirmed that the rice (Oryza sativa) CslF6 gene mediates the biosynthesis of MLG by overexpressing it in Nicotiana benthamiana. Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development. However, cslf6 mutants display a drastic decrease in MLG content (97% reduction in coleoptiles and virtually undetectable in other tissues). Immunodetection with an anti-MLG monoclonal antibody revealed that the coleoptiles and leaves retain trace amounts of MLG only in specific cell types such as sclerenchyma fibers. These results correlate with the absence of endogenous MLG synthase activity in mutant seedlings and 4-week-old sheaths. Mutant cell walls are weaker in mature stems but not seedlings, and more brittle in both stems and seedlings, compared to wild type. Mutants also display lesion mimic phenotypes in leaves, which correlates with enhanced defense-related gene expression and enhanced disease resistance. Taken together, our results underline a weaker role of MLG in cell expansion than previously thought, and highlight a structural role for MLG in nonexpanding, mature stem tissues in rice.
NA	Cell wall properties in Oryza sativa influence mesophyll CO2 conductance.	2018	New Phytol	School of Biological Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-4236, USA.	Diffusion of CO2 from the leaf intercellular air space to the site of carboxylation (gm ) is a potential trait for increasing net rates of CO2 assimilation (Anet ), photosynthetic efficiency, and crop productivity. Leaf anatomy plays a key role in this process; however, there are few investigations into how cell wall properties impact gm and Anet . Online carbon isotope discrimination was used to determine gm and Anet in Oryza sativa wild-type (WT) plants and mutants with disruptions in cell wall mixed-linkage glucan (MLG) production (CslF6 knockouts) under high- and low-light growth conditions. Cell wall thickness (Tcw ), surface area of chloroplast exposed to intercellular air spaces (Sc ), leaf dry mass per area (LMA), effective porosity, and other leaf anatomical traits were also analyzed. The gm of CslF6 mutants decreased by 83% relative to the WT, with c.<U+00A0>28% of the reduction in gm explained by Sc . Although Anet /LMA and Anet /Chl partially explained differences in Anet between genotypes, the change in cell wall properties influenced the diffusivity and availability of CO2 . The data presented here indicate that the loss of MLG in CslF6 plants had an impact on gm and demonstrate the importance of cell wall effective porosity and liquid path length on gm .
