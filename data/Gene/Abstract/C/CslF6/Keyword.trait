CslF6	stem	Loss of Cellulose synthase-like F6 function affects mixed-linkage glucan deposition, cell wall mechanical properties, and defense responses in vegetative tissues of rice	Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development
CslF6	height	Loss of Cellulose synthase-like F6 function affects mixed-linkage glucan deposition, cell wall mechanical properties, and defense responses in vegetative tissues of rice	Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development
CslF6	vegetative	Loss of Cellulose synthase-like F6 function affects mixed-linkage glucan deposition, cell wall mechanical properties, and defense responses in vegetative tissues of rice	Rice cslf6 knockout mutants show a slight decrease in height and stem diameter but otherwise grew normally during vegetative development
CslF6	cell wall	Cell wall properties in Oryza sativa influence mesophyll CO2 conductance.	 The data presented here indicate that the loss of MLG in CslF6 plants had an impact on gm and demonstrate the importance of cell wall effective porosity and liquid path length on gm
