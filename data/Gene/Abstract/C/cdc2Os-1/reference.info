Using probes obtained by PCR amplification, we have isolated two cognate rice cDNAs (cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2) encoding structural homologues of the cdc2+/CDC28 (cdc2) protein kinase from a cDNA library prepared from cultured rice cells. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2 showed that they are 83% identical. They are 62% identical to CDC28 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and much more similar to the yeast and mammalian p34cdc2 kinases than to rice R2, a cdc2-related kinase isolated previously by screening the same rice cDNA library with a different oligonucleotide probe. Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome. RNA blot analysis revealed that these genes are expressed in proliferating rice cells and in young rice seedlings. cdc2Os-1 could complement a temperature-sensitive yeast mutant of cdc28. However, despite the similarity in structure, both cdc2Os-2 and R2 were unable to complement the same mutant. Thus, the present results demonstrate the presence of structurally related, but functionally distinct cognates of the cdc2 cell cycle kinase in rice.

We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices. Transcripts of cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, and R2 were detected uniformly in the dividing region of the root apex. cdc2Os1 and cdc2Os2 were also expressed in differentiated cells such as those in the sclerenchyma, pericycle, and parenchyma of the central cylinder. By contrast, signals corresponding to transcripts of cdc2Os3 were distributed only in patches in the dividing region. Counterstaining of sections with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and double-target in situ hybridization with a probe for histone H4 transcripts revealed that cdc2Os3 transcripts were abundant from the G2 to the M phase, but were less abundant or absent during the S phase. The levels of the Cdc2Os3 protein and its associated histone H1-kinase activity were reduced by treatment of cultured cells with hydroxyurea, which blocks cycling cells at the onset of the S phase. Our results suggest that domains other than the conserved amino acid sequence (the PSTAIRE motif) have important roles in the function of non-PSTAIRE CDKs in distinct cell-cycle phases.

The activation of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) requires phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the T-loop by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). The R2 protein of rice is very similar to CAKs of animals and fission yeast at the amino acid level but phosphorylation by R2 has not yet been demonstrated. When R2 was overexpressed in a CAK-deficient mutant of budding yeast, it suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the mutation. Immunoprecipitates of rice proteins with the anti-R2 antibody phosphorylated human CDK2, one of the rice CDKs (Cdc2Os1), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II of Arabidopsis. Mutational analysis indicated that R2 phosphorylated the threonine residue within the T-loop of CDK2 and Cdc2Os1. R2 was found mainly in two protein complexes which had molecular masses of 190 kDa and 70 kDa, respectively, whilst the CDK- and CTD-kinase activities associated with R2 were identified in a complex of 105 kDa. These results indicate that R2 is closely related to CAKs of animals and fission yeast in terms of its phosphorylation activity and, moreover, that this CAK of rice is distinct from a CAK of the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis.
