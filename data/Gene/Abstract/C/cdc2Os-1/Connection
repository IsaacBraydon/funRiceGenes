cdc2Os-1|CDKA1	cdc2Os-2|CDKA2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants	Using probes obtained by PCR amplification, we have isolated two cognate rice cDNAs (cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2) encoding structural homologues of the cdc2+/CDC28 (cdc2) protein kinase from a cDNA library prepared from cultured rice cells
cdc2Os-1|CDKA1	cdc2Os-2|CDKA2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants	 Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of cdc2Os-1 and cdc2Os-2 showed that they are 83% identical
cdc2Os-1|CDKA1	cdc2Os-2|CDKA2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants	 Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome
cdc2Os-1|CDKA1	R2	Isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding cdc2 homologues from Oryza sativa: a functional homologue and cognate variants	 Southern blot analysis indicated that the three rice clones (cdc2Os-1, cdc2Os-2 and R2) are derived from distinct genes and are each found in a single copy per rice haploid genome
