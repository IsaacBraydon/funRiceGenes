Cga1	tiller	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
Cga1	transcription factor	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
Cga1	chloroplast	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Coexpression, microarray, and real-time expression analyses demonstrate a correlation between Cga1 expression and the expression of important nucleus-encoded, chloroplast-localized genes
Cga1	chloroplast	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
Cga1	chloroplast	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index
Cga1	chloroplast	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 These results indicate a conserved mechanism by which Cga1 regulates chloroplast development in higher plants
Cga1	senescence	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
Cga1	dwarf	Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture	 Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
