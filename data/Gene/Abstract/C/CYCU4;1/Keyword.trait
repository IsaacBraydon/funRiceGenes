CYCU4;1	leaf erectness	Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation	Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role  in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell proliferation.
CYCU4;1	cell proliferation	Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation	Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role  in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell proliferation.

CYCU4;1	Brassinosteroid	Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation	Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation
CYCU4;1	BR signaling	Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation	Furthermore, BR signaling inhibits the abaxial sclerenchyma cell division by coordinately regulating CYC U4;1 expression through BES1 and CYC U4;1 protein activity through GSK3 kinases.
