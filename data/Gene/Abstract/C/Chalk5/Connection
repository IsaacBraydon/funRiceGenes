Chalk5	GW5|qSW5	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles
Chalk5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW5, GW7, and Chalk5 and two QTLs were almost carried by the high-quality parents Cypress and Yuejingsimiao (YJSM), while the poor-quality parent Guichao-2 (GC2) always carried the inferior alleles
Chalk5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Bin-based genome-wide association studies reveal superior alleles for improvement of appearance quality using a 4-way MAGIC population in rice	1, GW7, Chalk5 and qPGWC8
Chalk5	OsbZIP60	OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.	 Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
Chalk5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.
Chalk5	GW7|GL7|SLG7|Chalk7	Verifying the Breeding Value of A Rare Haplotype of Chalk7, GS3, and Chalk5 to Improve Grain Appearance Quality in Rice.	 Three allele-specific markers for Chalk7, and two other grain genes (GS3 and Chalk5) were developed, and used to stack the desirable alleles at these loci
