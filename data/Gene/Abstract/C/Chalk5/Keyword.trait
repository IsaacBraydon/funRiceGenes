Chalk5	chalkiness	Chalk5 encodes a vacuolar H+-translocating pyrophosphatase influencing grain chalkiness in rice	Elevated expression of Chalk5 increases the chalkiness of the endosperm, putatively by disturbing the pH homeostasis of the endomembrane trafficking system in developing seeds, which affects the biogenesis of protein bodies and is coupled with a great increase in small vesicle-like structures, thus forming air spaces among endosperm storage substances and resulting in chalky grain.
