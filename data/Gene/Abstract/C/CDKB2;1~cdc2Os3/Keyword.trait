CDKB2;1|cdc2Os3|CDKB2	root	Differential expression of genes for cyclin-dependent protein kinases in rice plants	We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices
CDKB2;1|cdc2Os3|CDKB2	mitosis	CDKB2 is involved in mitosis and DNA damage response in rice	In addition, polyploid cells due to endomitosis were present in CDKB2;1 knockdown rice, suggesting an important role for Orysa;CDKB2;1 during mitosis
