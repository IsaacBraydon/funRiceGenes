We have analyzed the expression of four rice (Oryza sativa) CDK genes, cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, cdc2Os3, and R2, by in situ hybridization of sections of root apices. Transcripts of cdc2Os1, cdc2Os2, and R2 were detected uniformly in the dividing region of the root apex. cdc2Os1 and cdc2Os2 were also expressed in differentiated cells such as those in the sclerenchyma, pericycle, and parenchyma of the central cylinder. By contrast, signals corresponding to transcripts of cdc2Os3 were distributed only in patches in the dividing region. Counterstaining of sections with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and double-target in situ hybridization with a probe for histone H4 transcripts revealed that cdc2Os3 transcripts were abundant from the G2 to the M phase, but were less abundant or absent during the S phase. The levels of the Cdc2Os3 protein and its associated histone H1-kinase activity were reduced by treatment of cultured cells with hydroxyurea, which blocks cycling cells at the onset of the S phase. Our results suggest that domains other than the conserved amino acid sequence (the PSTAIRE motif) have important roles in the function of non-PSTAIRE CDKs in distinct cell-cycle phases.

DNA damage checkpoints delay mitotic cell-cycle progression in response to DNA stress, stalling the cell cycle to allow time for repair. CDKB is a plant-specific cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) that is required for the G(2)/M transition of the cell cycle. In Arabidopsis, DNA damage leads the degradation of CDKB2, and the subsequent G(2) arrest gives cells time to repair damaged DNA. G(2) arrest also triggers transition from the mitotic cycle to endoreduplication, leading to the presence of polyploid cells in many tissues. In contrast, in rice (Oryza sativa), polyploid cells are found only in the endosperm. It was unclear whether endoreduplication contributes to alleviating DNA damage in rice (Oryza sativa). Here, we show that DNA damage neither down-regulates Orysa;CDKB2;1 nor induces endoreduplication in rice. Furthermore, we found increased levels of Orysa;CDKB2;1 protein upon DNA damage. These results suggest that CDKB2 functions differently in Arabidopsis and rice in response to DNA damage. Arabidopsis may adopt endoreduplication as a survival strategy under genotoxic stress conditions, but rice may enhance DNA repair capacity upon genotoxic stress. In addition, polyploid cells due to endomitosis were present in CDKB2;1 knockdown rice, suggesting an important role for Orysa;CDKB2;1 during mitosis.
