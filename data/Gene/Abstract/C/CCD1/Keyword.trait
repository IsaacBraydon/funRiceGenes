CCD1	osmotic tolerance	OsCCD1, a novel small calcium-binding protein with one EF-hand motif, positively regulates osmotic and salt tolerance in rice.	OsCCD1, a novel small calcium-binding protein with one EF-hand motif, positively regulates osmotic and salt tolerance in rice.
CCD1	salt stress	OsCCD1, a novel small calcium-binding protein with one EF-hand motif, positively regulates osmotic and salt tolerance in rice.	OsCCD1 transcript levels were transiently induced by osmotic stress and salt stress through the calcium-mediated ABA signal.
