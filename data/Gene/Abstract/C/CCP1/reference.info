NA	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	2015	Plant J	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Shanghai), Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	Floral organ specification is controlled by various MADS-box genes in both dicots and monocots, whose expression is often subjected to both genetic and epigenetic regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the role of epigenetic modification of MADS-box genes during rice flower development. Here, we report the characterization of a rice gene, CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 (CCP1) that functions in palea development. Mutation in CCP1 resulted in abnormal palea with ectopic stigmatic tissues and other pleiotropic phenotypes. We found that OsMADS58, a C-class gene responsible for carpel morphogenesis, was ectopically expressed in the ccp1palea, indicating that the ccp1 palea was misspecified and partially acquired carpel-like identity. Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development. Map-based cloning revealed that CCP1 encodes a putative plant-specific EMBRYONIC FLOWER1 (EMF1)-like protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the level of the H3K27me3 at the OsMADS58 locus was greatly reduced in ccp1compared with that in the wild type. Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development.

NA	DS1/OsEMF1 interacts with OsARF11 to control rice architecture by regulation of brassinosteroid signaling.	2018	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory for Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Jiangsu Plant Gene Engineering Research Center, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	Plant height and leaf angle are important determinants of yield in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Genes involved in regulating plant height and leaf angle were identified in previous studies; however, there are many remaining unknown factors that affect rice architecture.In this study, we characterized a dwarf mutant named ds1 with small grain size and decreased leaf angle,selected from an irradiated population of ssp. japonica variety Nanjing35. The ds1 mutant also showed abnormal floral organs. ds1 plants were insensitive to BL treatment and expression of genes related to BR signaling was changed. An F2 population from a cross between ds1 and indica cultivar 93-11 was used to fine map DS1 and to map-based clone the DS1 allele, which encoded an EMF1-like protein that acted as a transcriptional regulator. DS1 was constitutively expressed in various tissues, and especially highly expressed in young leaves, panicles and seeds. We showed that the DS1 protein interacted with auxin response factor 11 (OsARF11), a major transcriptional regulator of plant height and leaf angle, to co-regulate D61/OsBRI1 expression. These findings provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DS1 integrates auxin and brassinosteroid signaling in rice.The DS1 gene encoded an EMF1-like protein in rice. The ds1 mutation altered the expression of genes related to BR signaling, and ds1<U+00A0>was insensitive to BL treatment. DS1 interacts with OsARF11 to co-regulate OsBRI1 expression.
