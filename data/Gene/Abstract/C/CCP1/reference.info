Floral organ specification is controlled by various MADS-box genes in both dicots and monocots, whose expression is often subjected to both genetic and epigenetic regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about the role of epigenetic modification of MADS-box genes during rice flower development. Here, we report the characterization of a rice gene, CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 (CCP1) that functions in palea development. Mutation in CCP1 resulted in abnormal palea with ectopic stigmatic tissues and other pleiotropic phenotypes. We found that OsMADS58, a C-class gene responsible for carpel morphogenesis, was ectopically expressed in the ccp1palea, indicating that the ccp1 palea was misspecified and partially acquired carpel-like identity. Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development. Map-based cloning revealed that CCP1 encodes a putative plant-specific EMBRYONIC FLOWER1 (EMF1)-like protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that the level of the H3K27me3 at the OsMADS58 locus was greatly reduced in ccp1compared with that in the wild type. Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development.
