CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	We found that OsMADS58, a C-class gene responsible for carpel morphogenesis, was ectopically expressed in the ccp1palea, indicating that the ccp1 palea was misspecified and partially acquired carpel-like identity
CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development
CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	OSMADS58	CURVED CHIMERIC PALEA 1 encoding an EMF1-like protein maintains epigenetic repression of OsMADS58 in rice palea development.	Taken together, our results show that CCP1 plays an important role in palea development through maintaining H3K27me3-mediated epigenetic silence of the carpel identity-specifying gene OsMADS58, shedding light on the epigenetic mechanism in floral organ development
CCP1|DFO1|EMF1|OsEMF1	PANDA	The Harbinger transposon-derived gene PANDA epigenetically coordinates panicle number and grain size in rice.	 Among the target genes, both OsMADS55 and OsEMF1 were negative regulators of panicle number but positive regulators of grain size, partly explaining the involvement of PANDA in balancing panicle number and grain size
