CCP1	 Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development	 Constitutive expression of OsMADS58 in the wild-type rice plants caused morphological abnormality of palea similar to that of ccp1, whereas OsMADS58 knockdown by RNAi in ccp1 could rescue the abnormal phenotype of mutant palea, suggesting that the repression of OsMADS58 expression by CCP1 is critical for palea development
