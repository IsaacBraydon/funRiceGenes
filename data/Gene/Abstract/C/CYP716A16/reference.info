NA	Rice (Oryza sativa L.) cytochrome P450 protein 716A subfamily CYP716A16 regulates disease resistance.	2022	BMC Genomics	College of Agronomy, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, China.	BACKGROUND: The sustainable development of rice production is facing severe threats by a variety of pathogens, such as necrotrophic Rhizoctonia solani and hemibiotrophic Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). Mining and applying resistance genes to increase the durable resistance of rice is an effective method that can be used to control these diseases. RESULTS: In this research, we isolated and characterized CYP716A16, which is a positive regulator of rice to R. solani AG1-IA and Xoo, and belongs to the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) protein 716A subfamily. Overexpression (OE) of CYP716A16 resulted in enhanced resistance to R. solani AG1-IA and Xoo, while RNA interference (RNAi) of CYP716A16 resulted in increased susceptibility compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Additionally, jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defense responses and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were activated in the CYP716A16-OE lines after R. solani AG1-IA inoculation. The comparative transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis of CYP716A16-OE and the WT lines showed that OE of CYP716A16 activated the biosynthesis of flavonoids and increased the amounts of narcissoside, methylophiopogonanone A, oroxin A, and amentoflavone in plants. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we suggest that JA-dependent response, ROS level, multiple resistance-related proteins, and flavonoid contents play an important role in CYP716A16-regulated R. solani AG1-IA and Xoo resistance. Our results broaden our knowledge regarding the function of a P450 protein 716A subfamily in disease resistance and provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of rice immune response.
