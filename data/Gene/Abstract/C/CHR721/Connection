CHR721	OsRPA1a	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.
CHR721	OsRPA1a	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice
CHR721	OsRPA1a	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	 CHR721 was found to interact with replication protein A (OsRPA1a), which is involved in DNA repair

CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 RESULTS: Here we discovered the C terminal of a chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box was essential for interacting with OsPCNA in rice
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 Both OsPCNA and CHR721 were localized in the nuclei and function in response to DNA damages
CHR721	OsPCNA|PCNA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	 CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and previous work, we proposed a working model that CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacted with OsPCNA and both of them probably participate in the DNA damage repair process
