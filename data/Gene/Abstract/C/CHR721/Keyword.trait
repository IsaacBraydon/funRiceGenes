CHR721	development	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice
CHR721	reproductive	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice

CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice
CHR721	male reproductive development	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice
CHR721	DNA repair	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	 CHR721 was found to interact with replication protein A (OsRPA1a), which is involved in DNA repair
CHR721	DNA repair	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	 The expressions of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints were consistently upregulated in chr721
