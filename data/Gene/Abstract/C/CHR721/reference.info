NA	CHR721, interacting with OsRPA1a, is essential for both male and female reproductive development in rice.	2020	Plant Mol Biol	National Centre for Plant Gene Research, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Developmental Biology, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 1 West Beichen Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, People's Republic of China.	CHR721 functions as a chromatin remodeler and interacts with a known single-stranded binding protein, OsRPA1a, to regulate both male and female reproductive development in rice. Reproductive development and fertility are important for seed production in rice. Here, we identified a sterile rice mutant, chr721, that exhibited defects in both male and female reproductive development. Approximately 5% of the observed defects in chr721, such as asynchronous dyad division, occurred during anaphase II of meiosis. During the mitotic stage, approximately 80% of uninucleate microspores failed to develop into tricellular pollen, leading to abnormal development. In addition, defects in megaspore development were detected after functional megaspore formation. CHR721, which encodes a nuclear protein belonging to the SNF2 subfamily SMARCAL1, was identified by map-based cloning. CHR721 was expressed in various tissues, especially in spikelets. CHR721 was found to interact with replication protein A (OsRPA1a), which is involved in DNA repair. The expressions of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints were consistently upregulated in chr721. Although numerous genes involved in male and female development have been identified, the mode of participation of chromatin-remodeling factors in reproductive development is still not well understood. Our results suggest that CHR721, a novel gene cloned from rice, plays a vital role in both male and female reproductive development.
NA	Chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacts with OsPCNA in Rice.	2022	BMC Plant Biol	College of Life Sciences, Henan Normal University, Xinxiang, China. zhangyushun@htu.edu.cn.	BACKGROUND: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is one of the key factors for the DNA replication process and DNA damage repair. Most proteins interacting with PCNA have a common binding motif: PCNA interacting protein box (PIP box). However, some proteins with non-canonical PIP-box have also been reported to be the key factors that interacted with PCNA. RESULTS: Here we discovered the C terminal of a chromatin-remodeling factor CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box was essential for interacting with OsPCNA in rice. Both OsPCNA and CHR721 were localized in the nuclei and function in response to DNA damages. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results and previous work, we proposed a working model that CHR721 with non-canonical PIP-box interacted with OsPCNA and both of them probably participate in the DNA damage repair process.
