CRC1	PAIR1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
CRC1	PAIR2	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
CRC1	ZEP1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion
CRC1	ZEP1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays
CRC1	OsMTOPVIB	OsMTOPVIB is required for meiotic bipolar spindle assembly.	 We further revealed that the mono-orientation of sister kinetochores was prevalent in OsmtopVIB, whereas biorientation of sister kinetochores was frequently observed in Osspo11-1, pair2, and crc1 In addition, mutations of the cohesion subunit OsREC8 resulted in biorientation of sister kinetochores as well as bipolar spindles even in the background of OsmtopVIB Therefore, we propose that biorientation of the kinetochore is required for bipolar spindle assembly in the absence of homologous recombination
