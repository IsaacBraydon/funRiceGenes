CRC1	PAIR1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	 CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
CRC1	PAIR2	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	 We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
CRC1	ZEP1	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	 CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion| Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays
