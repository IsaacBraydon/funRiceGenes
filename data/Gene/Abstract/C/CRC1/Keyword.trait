CRC1	meiosis	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	 CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
CRC1	meiotic	Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice	 Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation| We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
