CRL1|ARL1	 We tested CRL1 transcriptional activity in yeast and in planta, identified CRL1-regulated genes using an inducible gene expression system and a transcriptome analysis, and used in situ hybridization to demonstrate coexpression of a sample of CRL1-regulated genes with CRL1 in crown root primordia
CRL1|ARL1	 Eletrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transient expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) suggested that WOX11 and CRL1 directly bind to OsCKX4 to regulate its expression during crown root development |  Increased expression of OsCKX4 could partially complement the crown root phenotypes of both crl1 and wox11 mutants
