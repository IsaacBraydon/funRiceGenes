63249524.pdf	The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling	2011	Plant J	Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	Cytokinin is known to have negative effects on de novo auxin-induced root formation. However, the regulatory mechanisms of root initiation by both cytokinin and auxin are poorly understood. In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (crl5), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia. The expression of CRL5, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs. Exogenous auxin treatment induced CRL5 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, which also required the degradation of AUX/IAA proteins. A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation. A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation. In addition, ProACT:CRL5/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in crl5. Transgenic plants that over-expressed OsRR1 under the control of the CRL5 promoter in a crl5 mutant background produced a higher number of crown roots than the crl5 plant. Taken together, these results indicate that auxin-induced CRL5 promotes crown root initiation through repression of cytokinin signaling by positively regulating type-A RR, OsRR1.

WRKY transcription factors have many regulatory roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we isolated a rice WRKY gene (OsWRKY31) that is induced by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea and auxin. This gene encodes a polypeptide of 211 amino-acid residues and belongs to a subgroup of the rice WRKY gene family that probably originated after the divergence of monocot and dicot plants. OsWRKY31 was found to be localized to the nucleus of onion epidermis cells to transiently express OsWRKY31-eGFP fusion protein. Analysis of OsWRKY31 and its mutants fused with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain indicated that OsWRKY31 has transactivation activity in yeast. Overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene was found to enhance resistance against infection with M. grisea, and the transgenic lines exhibited reduced lateral root formation and elongation compared with wild-type and RNAi plants. The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes. Furthermore, the plants with overexpression were less sensitive to exogenously supplied IBA, NAA and 2,4-D at high concentrations, suggesting that overexpression of the OsWRKY31 gene might alter the auxin response or transport. These results also suggest that OsWRKY31 might be a common component in the signal transduction pathways of the auxin response and the defense response in rice.

B.Faiyue@sussex.ac.uk	An apoplastic pathway, the so-called bypass flow, is important for Na+ uptake in rice (Oryza sativa L.) under saline conditions; however, the precise site of entry is not yet known. We report the results of our test of the hypothesis that bypass flow of Na+ in rice occurs at the site where lateral roots emerge from the main roots. We investigated Na+ uptake and bypass flow in lateral rootless mutants (lrt1, lrt2), a crown rootless mutant (crl1), their wild types (Oochikara, Nipponbare and Taichung 65, respectively) and in seedlings of rice cv. IR36. The results showed that shoot Na+ concentration in lrt1, lrt2 and crl1 was lower (by 20-23%) than that of their wild types. In contrast, the bypass flow quantified using trisodium-8-hydroxy-1,3,6-pyrenetrisulphonic acid (PTS) was significantly increased in the mutants, from an average of 1.1% in the wild types to 3.2% in the mutants. Similarly, bypass flow in shoots of IR36 where the number of lateral and crown roots had been reduced through physical and hormonal manipulations was dramatically increased (from 5.6 to 12.5%) as compared to the controls. The results suggest that the path of bypass flow in rice is not at the sites of lateral root emergence.
j.1365-313X.2005.02434.x.pdf	ARL1, a LOB-domain protein required for adventitious root formation in rice	2005	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China.	Adventitious roots constitute the bulk of the fibrous root system in cereals. Compared with the current understanding of shoot development, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of development of the adventitious roots of cereals is limited. We have isolated and characterized a novel gene controlling the initiation of adventitious root primordia in rice (Oryza sativa L.). The gene, designated Adventitious rootless1 (ARL1), encodes a protein with a LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) domain. It is expressed in lateral and adventitious root primordia, tiller primordia, vascular tissues, scutellum, and young pedicels. ARL1 is a nuclear protein and can form homodimers. ARL1 is an auxin- and ethylene-responsive gene, and the expression pattern of ARL1 in roots parallels auxin distribution. Our findings suggest that ARL1 is an auxin-responsive factor involved in auxin-mediated cell dedifferentiation, and that it promotes the initial cell division in the pericycle cells adjacent to the peripheral vascular cylinder in the stem.
tpc1701387.pdf	Crown rootless1, which is essential for crown root formation in rice, is a target of an AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR in auxin signaling	2005	Plant Cell	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Nagoya, Aichi 464-8601, Japan.	Although the importance of auxin in root development is well known, the molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown. We characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant defective in crown root formation, crown rootless1 (crl1). The crl1 mutant showed additional auxin-related abnormal phenotypic traits in the roots, such as decreased lateral root number, auxin insensitivity in lateral root formation, and impaired root gravitropism, whereas no abnormal phenotypic traits were observed in aboveground organs. Expression of Crl1, which encodes a member of the plant-specific ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES protein family, was localized in tissues where crown and lateral roots are initiated and overlapped with beta-glucuronidase staining controlled by the DR5 promoter. Exogenous auxin treatment induced Crl1 expression without de novo protein biosynthesis, and this induction required the degradation of AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID proteins. Crl1 contains two putative auxin response elements (AuxREs) in its promoter region. The proximal AuxRE specifically interacted with a rice AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and acted as a cis-motif for Crl1 expression. We conclude that Crl1 encodes a positive regulator for crown and lateral root formation and that its expression is directly regulated by an ARF in the auxin signaling pathway.
NA	Identification of CROWN ROOTLESS1-regulated genes in rice reveals specific and conserved elements of postembryonic root formation.	2014	New Phytol	Université Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France.	In monocotyledons, the root system is mostly composed of postembryonic shoot-borne roots called crown roots. In rice (Oryza sativa), auxin promotes crown root initiation via the LOB-domain transcription factor (LBD) transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1); however, the gene regulatory network downstream of CRL1 remains largely unknown. We tested CRL1 transcriptional activity in yeast and in planta, identified CRL1-regulated genes using an inducible gene expression system and a transcriptome analysis, and used in situ hybridization to demonstrate coexpression of a sample of CRL1-regulated genes with CRL1 in crown root primordia. We show that CRL1 positively regulates 277 genes, including key genes involved in meristem patterning (such as QUIESCENT-CENTER SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX; QHB), cell proliferation and hormone homeostasis. Many genes are homologous to Arabidopsis genes involved in lateral root formation, but about a quarter are rice-specific. Our study reveals that several genes acting downstream of LBD transcription factors controlling postembryonic root formation are conserved between monocots and dicots. It also provides evidence that specific genes are involved in the formation of shoot-derived roots in rice.
NA	CROWN ROOTLESS1 binds DNA with a relaxed specificity and activates OsROP and OsbHLH044 genes involved in crown root formation in rice.	2022	Plant J	UMR DIADE, Université de Montpellier, IRD, CIRAD, 911 Avenue Agropolis, 34394, Montpellier, France.	In cereals, the root system is mainly composed of postembryonic shoot borne roots, named crown roots. The CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) transcription factor belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES DOMAIN (ASL/LBD) family is a key regulator of crown root initiation in rice. Here, we show that CRL1 can bind, both in vitro and in vivo, not only the LBD-box, a DNA sequence recognized by several ASL/LBD transcription factors, but also another not previously identified DNA motif that was named CRL1-box. Using rice protoplast transient transactivation assays and a set of previously identified CRL1-regulated genes, we confirm that CRL1 transactivates these genes if they possess at least a CRL1-box or a LBD-box in their promoters. In planta, ChIP-qPCR and a LBD -box in their promoter show that CRL1 binds preferentially the LBD-box in these promoter contexts. CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutation of these two CRL1-regulated genes, that encode a plant Rho GTPase (OsROP) and a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (OsbHLH044), show that both promote crown root development. Finally, we show that OsbHLH044 represses a regulatory module, uncovering how CRL1 regulates specific processes during crown root formation.
NA	WOX11 and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.	2022	New Phytol	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Crown root morphogenesis is critical for normal growth and nutrition absorption in cereals. In rice, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX11 (WOX11) and CROWN ROOTLESS1 (CRL1) play vital roles in controlling crown root development. Despite their importance, it remains unclear whether and how the two regulators coordinate crown root formation. Eletrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transient expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) suggested that WOX11 and CRL1 directly bind to OsCKX4 to regulate its expression during crown root development. CRL1 enhances OsCKX4 activation through direct interaction with WOX11 at root emergence and elongation stages. Genetic dissection showed that wox11/crl1 double mutant exhibits a more severe root phenotype. OsCKX4 knock-out plants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 exhibited fewer crown roots number and higher cytokinin levels in root meristem. Increased expression of OsCKX4 could partially complement the crown root phenotypes of both crl1 and wox11 mutants. Furthermore, cytokinin can promote WOX11 protein accumulation in root meristem. Together, these findings show that cytokinin accumulation is tightly regulated by the WOX11-CRL1 complex during crown root elongation by counter-acting on the negative regulatory effects of cytokinin on root development. Importantly, these results reveal an intrinsic link between WOX11 protein accumulation and cytokinin to maintain crown root growth.
