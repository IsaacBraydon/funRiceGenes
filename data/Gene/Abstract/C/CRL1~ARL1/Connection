CRL1|ARL1	Crl5	The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling	A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation
CRL1|ARL1	Crl5	The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling	A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation
CRL1|ARL1	OsPR10a|PBZ1	Constitutive expression of pathogen-inducible OsWRKY31 enhances disease resistance and affects root growth and auxin response in transgenic rice plants	The lines with overexpression showed constitutive expression of many defense-related genes, such as PBZ1 and OsSci2, as well as early auxin-response genes, such as OsIAA4 and OsCrl1 genes

CRL1|ARL1	QHB|OsQHB|OsWOX5	Identification of CROWN ROOTLESS1-regulated genes in rice reveals specific and conserved elements of postembryonic root formation.	We show that CRL1 positively regulates 277 genes, including key genes involved in meristem patterning (such as QUIESCENT-CENTER SPECIFIC HOMEOBOX; QHB), cell proliferation and hormone homeostasis
CRL1|ARL1	OsCKX4	WOX11 and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.	 Eletrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transient expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) suggested that WOX11 and CRL1 directly bind to OsCKX4 to regulate its expression during crown root development
CRL1|ARL1	OsCKX4	WOX11 and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.	 CRL1 enhances OsCKX4 activation through direct interaction with WOX11 at root emergence and elongation stages
CRL1|ARL1	OsCKX4	WOX11 and CRL1 act synergistically to promote crown root development by maintaining cytokinin homeostasis in rice.	 Increased expression of OsCKX4 could partially complement the crown root phenotypes of both crl1 and wox11 mutants
