CYP76C6	resistance	Expression of CYP76C6 Facilitates Isoproturon Metabolism and Detoxification in Rice.	 To verify the role of CYP76C6 in rice resistance to IPU toxicity, CYP76C6 overexpression (OEs) and knockout mutant rice by CRISPR/Cas9 were generated through genetic transformation and gene-editing technologies
