CycB1;1	cold stress	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	" Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced"
CycB1;1	mitosis	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	 We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2
CycB1;1	chilling	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	 These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
CycB1;1	cell cycle	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	 These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress
CycB1;1	endosperm	The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice	 Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo| The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm| Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice|The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice
CycB1;1	seed	The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice	 In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo
