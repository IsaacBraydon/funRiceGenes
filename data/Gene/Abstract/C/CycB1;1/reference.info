Ma-2009-Enhanced tolerance t.pdf	Enhanced tolerance to chilling stress in OsMYB3R-2 transgenic rice is mediated by alteration in cell cycle and ectopic expression of stress genes	2009	Plant Physiol	Research Center for Molecular and Developmental Biology, Key Laboratory of Photosynthesis and Environmental Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100093, China.	MYB transcription factors play central roles in plant responses to abiotic stresses. How stress affects development is poorly understood. Here, we show that OsMYB3R-2 functions in both stress and developmental processes in rice (Oryza sativa). Transgenic plants overexpressing OsMYB3R-2 exhibited enhanced cold tolerance. Cold treatment greatly induced the expression of OsMYB3R-2, which encodes an active transcription factor. We show that OsMYB3R-2 specifically bound to a mitosis-specific activator cis-element, (T/C)C(T/C)AACGG(T/C)(T/C)A, a conserved sequence that was found in promoters of cyclin genes such as OsCycB1;1 and OsKNOLLE2. In addition, overexpression of OsMYB3R-2 in rice led to higher transcript levels of several G2/M phase-specific genes, including OsCycB1;1, OsCycB2;1, OsCycB2;2, and OsCDC20.1, than those in OsMYB3R-2 antisense lines or wild-type plants in response to cold treatment. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increased cell mitotic index in overexpressed transgenic lines of OsMYB3R-2 after cold treatment. Furthermore, resistance to cold stress in the transgenic plants overexpressing OsCycB1;1 was also enhanced. The level of cellular free proline was increased in the overexpressed rice lines of OsMYB3R-2 and OsCycB1;1 transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants under the cold treatment. These results suggest that OsMYB3R-2 targets OsCycB1;1 and regulates the progress of the cell cycle during chilling stress. OsCPT1, which may be involved in the dehydration-responsive element-binding factor 1A pathway, showed the same transcription pattern in response to cold as did OsCycB1;1 in transgenic rice. Therefore, a cold resistance mechanism in rice could be mediated by regulating the cell cycle, which is controlled by key genes including OsMYB3R-2.
art%3A10.1007%2Fs00425-009-1051-y.pdf	The expression of Orysa;CycB1;1 is essential for endosperm formation and causes embryo enlargement in rice	2010	Planta	College of Life Sciences, Northeast Forestry University, 150040 Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.	The cell cycle is an important process during seed development in plants and its progression is driven by a number of core regulators such as the cyclins. Currently, however, little is known regarding the role of the cyclins in embryo and endosperm development in cereals. In our current study, we show that the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 in rice results in the production of abnormal seeds, which at maturity contain only an enlarged embryo. It was further found that a delayed and abnormal cellularization occurred in the endosperm in these knockdown seeds which eventually became abortive. Moreover, the observed development of the enlarged embryo was also morphologically abnormal and found to be caused by an enlarged cell size rather than an increased cell number. Expression analysis showed that Orysa;CycB1;1 transcripts were localized in the endosperm and embryo. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling further indicated that a large number of genes are responsible for the phenotype of the enlarged embryo. The results of the knockdown of Orysa;CycB1;1 via an endosperm or an embryo-specific promoter also suggest that the enlarged embryo may be correlated to the abortive endosperm. Our results suggest that Orysa;CycB1;1 expression is critical for endosperm formation via the regulation of mitotic division, and that the endosperm plays an important role in maintenance of embryo development in rice.
