CTB4a	temperature	Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.	 We show that different CTB4a alleles confer distinct levels of cold tolerance and selection for variation in the CTB4a promoter region has occurred on the basis of environmental temperature
CTB4a	seed	Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.	 Upregulation of CTB4a correlates with increased ATP synthase activity, ATP content, enhanced seed setting and improved yield under cold stress conditions
CTB4a	tolerance	Natural variation in CTB4a enhances rice adaptation to cold habitats.	 Here we explored a QTL for cold tolerance and cloned the gene, CTB4a (cold tolerance at booting stage), encoding a conserved leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase
