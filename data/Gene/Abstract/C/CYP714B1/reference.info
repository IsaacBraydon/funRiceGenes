Bioactive gibberellins (GAs) control many aspects of growth and development in plants. GA(1) has been the most frequently found bioactive GA in various tissues of flowering plants, but the enzymes responsible for GA(1) biosynthesis have not been fully elucidated due to the enzymes catalyzing the 13-hydroxylation step not being identified. Because of the lack of mutants defective in this enzyme, biological significance of GA 13-hydroxylation has been unknown. Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism. There was a trend that the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were increased in these transgenic plants. Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro. Moreover, the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were decreased, whereas those of 13-H GAs including GA(4) (which is more active than GA(1)) were increased, in the rice cyp714b1 cyp714b2 double mutant. These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice. The double mutant plants appear phenotypically normal until heading, but show elongated uppermost internode at the heading stage. Moreover, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 expression was up-regulated by exogenous application of bioactive GAs. Our results suggest that GA 13-oxidases play a role in fine-tuning plant growth by decreasing GA bioactivity in rice and that they also participate in GA homeostasis.
NA	Rice GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR7 Modulates Plant Architecture through Regulating GA and IAA Metabolism	2020	Plant Physiol	Wuhan University CITY: Wuhan STATE: Hubei China [CN].	Plant-specific GROWTH-REGULATING FACTORs (GRFs) participate in central developmental processes, including leaf and root development; inflorescence, flower and seed formation; senescence; and tolerance to stresses. In rice (Oryza sativa), there are 12 GRFs, but the role of the miR396-OsGRF7 regulatory module remains unknown. Here, we report that OsGRF7 shapes plant architecture via the regulation of auxin and gibberellin metabolism in rice. OsGRF7 is mainly expressed in lamina joints, nodes, internodes, axillary buds, and young inflorescences. Overexpression of OsGRF7 causes a semidwarf and compact plant architecture with an increased culm wall thickness and narrowed leaf angles mediated by shortened cell length, altered cell arrangement, and increased parenchymal cell layers in the culm and adaxial side of the lamina joints. Knock-out and knock-down lines of OsGRF7 exhibit contrasting phenotypes with severe degradation of parenchymal cells in the culm and lamina joints at maturity. Further analysis indicated that OsGRF7 binds the ACRGDA motif in the promoters of Cytochrome P450 gene (OsCYP714B1) and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 12 (OsARF12), which are involved in the gibberellin synthesis and auxin signaling pathways, respectively. Correspondingly, OsGRF7 alters the contents of endogenous gibberellins and auxins and sensitivity to exogenous phytohormones. These findings establish OsGRF7 as a crucial component in the OsmiR396-OsGRF-plant hormone regulatory network that controls rice plant architecture.
