CYP714B1	dwarf	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism
CYP714B1	insect	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro
CYP714B1	gibberellin	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice
CYP714B1	 ga 	CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice	 Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice| These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice
