CIGR1	defense reactions	Identification and characterization of two new members of the GRAS gene family in rice responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor	Localization experiments using GFP-fusions of both CIGR1 and CIGR2 in a transient onion assay confirmed the nuclear localization of both rice proteins (Fig. 2), supporting the possible role of each as transcriptional regulators in the defense reactions.
CIGR1	elicitor-response	Identification and characterization of two new members of the GRAS gene family in rice responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor	The fact that the induction of CIGR1 and CIGR2 is not inhibited by pretreatment with cycloheximide strongly indicates that these two gene products act in the early step of the elicitor-response.
