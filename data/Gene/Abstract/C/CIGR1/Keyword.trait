CIGR1	defense reactions.	Identification and characterization of two new members of the GRAS gene family in rice responsive to N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor	Localization experiments using GFP-fusions of both CIGR1 and CIGR2 in a transient onion assay confirmed the nuclear localization of both rice proteins (Fig. 2), supporting the possible role of each as transcriptional regulators in the defense reactions.
