CYP90D3	D2|CYP90D2	Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro	 We report the biochemical characterization of two brassinosteroid-biosynthetic P450s from rice: CYP90D2 and CYP90D3| However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies| These results indicate that CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 can act as brassinosteroid C-23 hydroxylases in rice|Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro
