Ctb1	cold tolerance	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice	" We previously identified two closely linked quantitative trait loci, Ctb1 and Ctb2, for cold tolerance at the booting stage of Norin-PL8 in the long arm of chromosome 4
Ctb1	cold tolerance	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice	 A comparison of the degrees of cold tolerance of the NILs indicated that Ctb1 is located in the 56-kb region covered by a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, OSJNBa0058 K23, that had been sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequence Project
Ctb1	cold tolerance	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice	 We were also able to show that Ctb1 is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage
Ctb1	cold tolerance	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice"
Ctb1	anther	Physical mapping and putative candidate gene identification of a quantitative trait locus Ctb1 for cold tolerance at the booting stage of rice	 We were also able to show that Ctb1 is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage
Ctb1	cold tolerance	Map-based cloning of the rice cold tolerance gene Ctb1	" We previously mapped a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance, Ctb1, to a 56-kb region containing 7 putative genes
Ctb1	cold tolerance	Map-based cloning of the rice cold tolerance gene Ctb1	Map-based cloning of the rice cold tolerance gene Ctb1"
