We previously mapped a quantitative trait locus for cold tolerance, Ctb1, to a 56-kb region containing 7 putative genes. In this study we further mapped Ctb1 to a 17-kb region containing two genes that encode an F-box protein and a ser/thr protein kinase. The F-box protein gene was preferentially expressed in young panicles, while the ser/thr protein kinase gene was expressed in leaves and young panicles. Both genes were cloned from a cold-tolerant variety, Norin-PL8, and introduced into a cold-sensitive variety, Hokkai241, and a cold-sensitive line, BT4-74-8. The cold tolerance of T2 and T3 progenies was assessed by measuring the degree of spikelet fertility in plants treated with cool water irrigation (19 Â°C, 25 cm) or cool air (12 Â°C, 4 days). The results indicated that the F-box protein gene confers cold tolerance. Cold tolerance is associated with greater anther length, and the transgenic plants had longer anthers than non-transformed controls. The F-box protein interacts with a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Skp1, suggesting that an ubiquitinâ€“proteasome pathway is involved in cold tolerance at the booting stage.

We previously identified two closely linked quantitative trait loci, Ctb1 and Ctb2, for cold tolerance at the booting stage of Norin-PL8 in the long arm of chromosome 4. We report here the physical mapping of Ctb1 and the identification of the candidate genes. A total of 2,008 segregating individuals were screened for recombination in the Ctb1 region by a PCR-based screening, and a series of near-isogenic lines (NILs) were developed from progenies of recombinants. A comparison of the degrees of cold tolerance of the NILs indicated that Ctb1 is located in the 56-kb region covered by a bacterial artificial chromosome clone, OSJNBa0058 K23, that had been sequenced by the International Rice Genome Sequence Project. We found seven open reading frames (ORFs) in the 56-kb region. Two ORFs encoded receptor-like protein kinases that are possibly involved in signal transduction pathways. Proteins that may be associated with a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway were encoded by three ORFs, two of which encoded F-box proteins and one of which encoded a protein with a BAG domain. The other two ORFs encoded a protein with an OTU domain and an unknown protein. We were also able to show that Ctb1 is likely to be associated with anther length, which is one of major factors in cold tolerance at the booting stage.

We previously detected quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for cold tolerance of Norin-PL8 in the introgressions on chromosomes 3 and 4. We provide fine mapping of the QTLs on chromosome 4 and the association between the QTLs and anther length, which has been reported to be a major component of cold tolerance. Interval mapping using a segregating population derived from an advanced backcross progeny indicated that a QTL for cold tolerance is probably located from the center to the proximal end of the introgression. For fine mapping, we developed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) from recombinants in the segregating population. Comparison of cold tolerance between the NILs indicated that either the proximal end or the center of the introgression is necessary for cold tolerance. From these results, we concluded that there are at least two QTLs for cold tolerance, tentatively designated as Ctb-1 and Ctb-2, in the introgression on chromosome 4. The map distance between Ctb-1 and Ctb-2 is estimated to be 4.7â€<U+393C><U+3E33>17.2 cM. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying cold tolerance by the QTLs, we compared anther lengths of the NILs. The results indicate that both Ctb-1 and Ctb-2 are associated with anther length.
