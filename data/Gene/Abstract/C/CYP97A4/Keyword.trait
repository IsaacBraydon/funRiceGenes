CYP97A4	sheath	Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis	The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
CYP97A4	spikelet	Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis	The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
CYP97A4	chloroplast	Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis	The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
CYP97A4	leaf	Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis	The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
CYP97A4	root	Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis	The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
