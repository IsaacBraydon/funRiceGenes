CRK6	immunity	A Genetic Screen Identifies a Requirement for Cysteine-Rich-Receptor-Like Kinases in Rice NH1 (OsNPR1)-Mediated Immunity.	These results confirm the requirement of CRK6 and CRK10 for NH1-mediated immunity.
CRK6	immune response	A Genetic Screen Identifies a Requirement for Cysteine-Rich-Receptor-Like Kinases in Rice NH1 (OsNPR1)-Mediated Immunity.	Here we provide direct and robust genetic evidence that the CRK6 and CRK10 genes mediate BTH-induced immune response.
