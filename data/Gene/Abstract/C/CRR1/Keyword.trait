CRR1	vascular bundle	CRR1 encoding callose synthase functions in ovary expansion by affecting vascular cell patterning in rice.	Analysis of pCRR1::GUS transgenic plants showed that CRR1 was specifically expressed in vascular bundle cells
CRR1	vascular bundle	CRR1 encoding callose synthase functions in ovary expansion by affecting vascular cell patterning in rice.	Furthermore, a small portion of cells in the vascular bundles of crr1 showed defective cell wall formation, and callose deposition was specifically reduced at the plasmodesmata (PD) of cells with aberrant walls
CRR1	map-based cloning	CRR1 encoding callose synthase functions in ovary expansion by affecting vascular cell patterning in rice.	Map-based cloning revealed that CRR1 encodes a protein homologous to Arabidopsis callose synthases AtGSL8 and AtGSL10
CRR1	cell wall	CRR1 encoding callose synthase functions in ovary expansion by affecting vascular cell patterning in rice.	Furthermore, a small portion of cells in the vascular bundles of crr1 showed defective cell wall formation, and callose deposition was specifically reduced at the plasmodesmata (PD) of cells with aberrant walls
