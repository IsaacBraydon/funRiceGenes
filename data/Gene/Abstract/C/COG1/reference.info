Improvement of chilling tolerance is a key strategy to face potential menace from abnormal temperature in rice production, which depends on the signaling network triggered by receptors. However, little is known about the QTL genes encoding membrane complexes for sensing cold. Here, Chilling-tolerance in Gengdao/japonica rice 1 (COG1) is isolated from a chromosome segment substitution line containing a QTL (qCS11-jap) for chilling sensitivity. The major gene COG1 is found to confer chilling tolerance in japonica rice. In natural rice populations, only the haplogroup1 encodes a functional COG1. Evolutionary analysis show that COG1 originates from Chinese O. Rufipogon and is fixed in japonica rice during domestication. COG1, a membrane-localized LRR-RLP, targets and activates the kinase OsSERL2 in a cold-induced manner, promoting chilling tolerance. Furthermore, the cold signal transmitted by COG1-OsSERL2 activates OsMAPK3 in the cytoplasm. Our findings reveal a cold-sensing complex, which mediates signaling network for the chilling defense in rice.
