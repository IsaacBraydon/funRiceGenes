CSN6	IDEF1	CSN6, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, is involved in early response to iron deficiency in Oryza sativa.	 In contrast to CSN6, the IDEF1 protein and expression of several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes are increased in response to -Fe
CSN6	IDEF1	CSN6, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, is involved in early response to iron deficiency in Oryza sativa.	 Thus, we constructed CSN6 transgenic sense and antisense lines and found that experimental depletion of CSN6 results in accumulation of the IDEF1 protein and up-regulation of several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes
CSN6	IDEF1	CSN6, a subunit of the COP9 signalosome, is involved in early response to iron deficiency in Oryza sativa.	 Collectively, the cellular CSN6 level is decreased during early stages of -Fe to ensure the rapid accumulation of IDEF1, which in turn up-regulates several iron uptake/utilisation-related genes to help overcome -Fe stress in rice
