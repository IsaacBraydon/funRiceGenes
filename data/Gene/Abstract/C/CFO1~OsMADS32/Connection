CFO1|OsMADS32	DL	CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS1, encoding a monocot-specific MADS box protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	 The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers| Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers| We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression
