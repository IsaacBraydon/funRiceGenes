CFO1|OsMADS32	DL	CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS1, encoding a monocot-specific MADS box protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice	 The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers| Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers| We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression
CFO1|OsMADS32	OsMADS2	OsMADS32 interacts with PI-like proteins and regulates rice flower development.	 By yeast two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we revealed that the insertion of eight amino acids or deletion of the internal region in the K1 subdomain of OsMADS32 affects the interaction between OsMADS32 with PISTILLATA (PI)-like proteins OsMADS2 and OsMADS4
