NA	Characterization of Jasmonoyl-Isoleucine (JA-Ile) Hormonal Catabolic Pathways in Rice upon Wounding and Salt Stress.	2019	Rice (N Y)	Institut de Biologie Moléculaire des Plantes (IBMP) du CNRS, Université de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.	BACKGROUND: Jasmonate (JA) signaling and functions have been established in rice development and response to a range of biotic or abiotic stress conditions. However, information on the molecular actors and mechanisms underlying turnover of the bioactive jasmonoyl-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is very limited in this plant species. RESULTS: Here we explored two gene families in rice in which some members were described previously in Arabidopsis to encode enzymes metabolizing JA-Ile hormone, namely cytochrome P450 of the CYP94 subfamily (CYP94, 20 members) and amidohydrolases (AH, 9 members). The CYP94D subclade, of unknown function, was most represented in the rice genome with about 10 genes. We used phylogeny and gene expression analysis to narrow the study to candidate members that could mediate JA-Ile catabolism upon leaf wounding used as mimic of insect chewing or seedling exposure to salt, two stresses triggering jasmonate metabolism and signaling. Both treatments induced specific transcriptional changes, along with accumulation of JA-Ile and a complex array of oxidized jasmonate catabolites, with some of these responses being abolished in the JASMONATE RESISTANT 1 (jar1) mutant. However, upon response to salt, a lower dependence on JAR1 was evidenced. Dynamics of CYP94B5, CYP94C2, CYP94C4 and AH7 transcripts matched best the accumulation of JA-Ile catabolites. To gain direct insight into JA-Ile metabolizing activities, recombinant expression of some selected genes was undertaken in yeast and bacteria. CYP94B5 was demonstrated to catalyze C12-hydroxylation of JA-Ile, whereas similarly to its Arabidopsis bi-functional homolog IAR3, AH8 performed cleavage of JA-Ile and auxin-alanine conjugates. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shed light on two rice gene families encoding enzymes related to hormone homeostasis. Expression data along with JA profiling and functional analysis identifies likely actors of JA-Ile catabolism in rice seedlings. This knowledge will now enable to better understand the metabolic fate of JA-Ile and engineer optimized JA signaling under stress conditions.
