Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a green color due to the accumulation of chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts. Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (Mg-chelatase) comprises three subunits (ChlH, ChlD and ChlI) and catalyzes the insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX, the last common intermediate precursor in both chlorophyll and heme biosyntheses, to produce Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto). Chlorophyll deficiency in higher plants results in chlorina (yellowish-green) phenotype. To date, 10 chlorina (chl) mutants have been isolated in rice, but the corresponding genes have not yet been identified. Rice Chl1 and Chl9 genes were mapped to chromosome 3 and isolated by map-based cloning. A missense mutation occurred in a highly conserved amino acid of ChlD in the chl1 mutant and ChlI in the chl9 mutant. Ultrastructural analyses have revealed that the grana are poorly stacked, resulting in the underdevelopment of chloroplasts. In the seedlings fed with aminolevulinate-dipyridyl in darkness, MgProto levels in the chl1 and chl9 mutants decreased up to 25% and 31% of that in wild-type, respectively, indicating that the Mg-chelatase activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in chlorophyll synthesis. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis indicated that the nuclear genes encoding the three subunits of Mg-chelatase and LhcpII in chl1 mutant are expressed about 2-fold higher than those in WT, but are not altered in the chl9 mutant. This result indicates that the ChlD subunit participates in negative feedback regulation of plastid-to-nucleus in the expression of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins, but not the ChlI subunit.
NA	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	2023	Plants (Basel)	Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture and Life Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Republic of Korea.	Chlorophyll biosynthesis is a crucial biological process in plants, and chlorophyll content is one of the most important traits in rice breeding programs. In this study, we identified a lethal, chlorophyll-deficient, yellow seedling (YS) phenotype segregating in progeny of CR5055-21, an F(2) plant derived from a backcross between Korean japonica variety &#x27;Hwaseong&#x27; (Oryza sativa) and CR5029, which is mostly Hwaseong with a small amount of Oryza grandiglumis chromosome segments. The segregation of the mutant phenotype was consistent with a single gene recessive mutation. Light microscopy of YS leaf cross-sections revealed loosely arranged mesophyll cells and sparse parenchyma in contrast to wildtype. In addition, transmission electron microscopy showed that chloroplasts did not develop in the mesophyll cells of the YS mutant. Quantitative trait loci (QTL)-seq analysis did not detect any significant QTL, however, examination of the individual delta-SNP index identified a 2-bp deletion (AG) in the OsCHLI gene, a magnesium (Mg)-chelatase subunit. A dCAPs marker was designed and genotyping of a segregating population (n = 275) showed that the mutant phenotype co-segregated with the marker. The 2-bp deletion was predicted to result in a frameshift mutation generating a premature termination. The truncated protein likely affects formation and function of Mg-chelatase, which consists of three different subunits that together catalyze the first committed step of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Transcriptome analysis showed that photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly altered and carotenoid-related genes were also differentially expressed in the YS mutant. Our findings demonstrated that OsCHLI plays an important role in leaf pigment biosynthesis and leaf structure development in rice.
