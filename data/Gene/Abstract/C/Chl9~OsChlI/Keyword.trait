Chl9|OsChlI	seedling	Rice Chlorina-1 and Chlorina-9 encode ChlD and ChlI subunits of Mg-chelatase, a key enzyme for chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast development	In the seedlings fed with aminolevulinate-dipyridyl in darkness, MgProto levels in the chl1 and chl9 mutants decreased up to 25% and 31% of that in wild-type, respectively, indicating that the Mg-chelatase activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in chlorophyll synthesis
Chl9|OsChlI	leaf	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	 Our findings demonstrated that OsCHLI plays an important role in leaf pigment biosynthesis and leaf structure development in rice
Chl9|OsChlI	development	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	 Our findings demonstrated that OsCHLI plays an important role in leaf pigment biosynthesis and leaf structure development in rice
Chl9|OsChlI	seedling	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.
Chl9|OsChlI	magnesium	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	 Quantitative trait loci (QTL)-seq analysis did not detect any significant QTL, however, examination of the individual delta-SNP index identified a 2-bp deletion (AG) in the OsCHLI gene, a magnesium (Mg)-chelatase subunit
Chl9|OsChlI	pigment biosynthesis	A Frameshift Mutation in the Mg-Chelatase I Subunit Gene OsCHLI Is Associated with a Lethal Chlorophyll-Deficient, Yellow Seedling Phenotype in Rice.	 Our findings demonstrated that OsCHLI plays an important role in leaf pigment biosynthesis and leaf structure development in rice
