NA	The Rice CK2 Kinase Regulates Trafficking of Phosphate Transporters in Response to Phosphate Levels.	2015	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.	Phosphate transporters (PTs) mediate phosphorus uptake and are regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. In one key mechanism of posttranslational regulation, phosphorylation of PTs affects their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane. However, the kinase(s) mediating PT phosphorylation and the mechanism leading to ER retention of phosphorylated PTs remain unclear. In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) kinase subunit, CK2Î²3, which interacts with PT2 and PT8 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Also, the CK2Î±3/Î²3 holoenzyme phosphorylates PT8 under phosphate-sufficient conditions. This phosphorylation inhibited the interaction of PT8 with PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1, a key cofactor regulating the exit of PTs from the ER to the plasma membrane. Additionally, phosphorus starvation promoted CK2Î²3 degradation, relieving the negative regulation of PT phosphorus-insufficient conditions. In accordance, transgenic expression of a nonphosphorylatable version of OsPT8 resulted in elevated levels of that protein at the plasma membrane and enhanced phosphorus accumulation and plant growth under various phosphorus regimes. Taken together, these results indicate that CK2Î±3/Î²3 negatively regulates PTs and phosphorus status regulates CK2Î±3/Î²3.
NA	CASEIN KINASE2-Dependent Phosphorylation of PHOSPHATE2 Fine-tunes Phosphate Homeostasis in Rice.	2020	Plant Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	Plants have evolved complex physiological and biochemical mechanisms to adapt to a heterogeneous soil phosphorus (P) environment. PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2) is a phosphate (Pi) starvation-signaling regulator involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis in plants. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) PHO2 targets PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) and PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) for degradation, whereas rice (Oryza sativa) PHO2 is thought to mediate PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER TRAFFIC FACILITATOR1 (PHF1) degradation. However, it is unclear whether and how PHO2 is posttranslationally regulated. Here, we show that in rice, the CASEIN KINASE2 (OsCK2) catalytic subunit OsCK2¦Á3 interacts with OsPHO2 in vitro and in vivo in vascular tissues cells, and phosphorylates OsPHO2 at Ser-841. Phosphorylated OsPHO2 is degraded more rapidly than native OsPHO2 in cell-free degradation assays. OsPHO2 interacts with OsPHO1 and targets it for degradation through a multivesicular body-mediated pathway. PHO1 mutation partially rescued the pho2 mutant phenotype. Further genetic analysis showed that a nonphosphorylatable version of OsPHO2 rescued the Ospho2 phenotype of high Pi accumulation in leaves better than native OsPHO2. In addition to the previously established role of OsCK2 in negatively regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit of PHT1 phosphate transporters, this work uncovers a role for OsCK2¦Á3 in modulating Pi homeostasis through regulating the phosphorylation status and abundance of OsPHO2 in rice.
