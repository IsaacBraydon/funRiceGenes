Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a green color due to the accumulation of chlorophyll pigments in chloroplasts. Mg-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (Mg-chelatase) comprises three subunits (ChlH, ChlD and ChlI) and catalyzes the insertion of Mg(2+) into protoporphyrin IX, the last common intermediate precursor in both chlorophyll and heme biosyntheses, to produce Mg-protoporphyrin IX (MgProto). Chlorophyll deficiency in higher plants results in chlorina (yellowish-green) phenotype. To date, 10 chlorina (chl) mutants have been isolated in rice, but the corresponding genes have not yet been identified. Rice Chl1 and Chl9 genes were mapped to chromosome 3 and isolated by map-based cloning. A missense mutation occurred in a highly conserved amino acid of ChlD in the chl1 mutant and ChlI in the chl9 mutant. Ultrastructural analyses have revealed that the grana are poorly stacked, resulting in the underdevelopment of chloroplasts. In the seedlings fed with aminolevulinate-dipyridyl in darkness, MgProto levels in the chl1 and chl9 mutants decreased up to 25% and 31% of that in wild-type, respectively, indicating that the Mg-chelatase activity is significantly reduced, causing the eventual decrease in chlorophyll synthesis. Furthermore, Northern blot analysis indicated that the nuclear genes encoding the three subunits of Mg-chelatase and LhcpII in chl1 mutant are expressed about 2-fold higher than those in WT, but are not altered in the chl9 mutant. This result indicates that the ChlD subunit participates in negative feedback regulation of plastid-to-nucleus in the expression of nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins, but not the ChlI subunit.
NA	N-terminus plus linker domain of Mg-chelatase D subunit is essential for Mg-chelatase activity in Oryza sativa.	2018	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Department of Horticulture, College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agricultural University, Nanchang, 330045, PR China. Electronic address: rosalycake@163.com.	Mg chelatase, a key enzyme in chlorophyll biosynthesis, is comprised of I, D and H subunits. Among these subunits, the D subunit was regarded to mediate protein interactions due to its unique protein domains. However, the functional roles of the different domains of the D subunit in vivo remain unclear. In this study, we dissected the rice (Oryza sativa) D subunit (OsCHLD) into three peptide fragments: the putative chloroplast transit peptide (TP, Met1 to Arg45), the N-terminus plus linker domain (OsCHLDN<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>L, Ala46 to Leu485) and the C-terminus (OsCHLDC, Ile486 to Ser754), to explore the roles of these fragments. The results of the yeast two-hybrid assay and the in vitro reconstitution of the Mg-chelatase activity showed that only OsCHLDN<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>L interacted with the I and H subunits and maintained most of the Mg-chelatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, artificial TP-OsCHLDN<U+202F>+<U+202F>L and TP-OsCHLDC were overexpressed in rice. Interestingly, an incomplete co-suppression had occurred in both of the overexpressed (OsCHLDN<U+202F>+<U+202F>L-ox and OsCHLDC-ox) plants, resulting in a significantly downregulated expression of endogenous OsCHLD. Therefore, these transgenic plants had adequate OsCHLDN<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>L and OsCHLDC instead of endogenous OsCHLD, providing ideal models to study the function of different domains of the D subunit in vivo. The OsCHLDN<U+202F>+<U+202F>L-ox plants showed an identical phenotype to that of the wild type, while the OsCHLDC-ox plants demonstrated a yellowish phenotype that resembled the D subunit mutants. These results indicated that only OsCHLDN<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>L could complement the function of endogenous OsCHLD, providing direct evidence that OsCHLDN<U+00A0>+<U+00A0>L is essential for Mg-chelatase activity in vivo.
