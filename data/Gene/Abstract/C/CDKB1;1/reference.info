23_211.pdf	Isolation and characterization of a rice cDNA encoding B1-type cyclin-dependent kinase	2006	Plant Biotechnology	Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are central players that control the cell cycle. In plants, A- and B-type CDKs are directly involved in cell cycle regulation. B-type CDK (CDKB) is unique to plants; however, only limited information on this kinase has been accumulated thus far. In the present study, we identified a rice cDNA encoding CDKB1;1 and studied its expression in suspension-cultured cells and plant tissues. We found that this enzyme was expressed in actively dividing cells in suspension cultures and was downregulated by the depletion of sucrose from the medium. In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs. These results suggested that CDKB1 is mainly involved in mitotic cell division during plant development.
NA	Multi-gene knockout utilizing off-target mutations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genome Engineering Research Unit, Agrogenomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan.	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) has been demonstrated to be a robust genome engineering tool in a variety of organisms including plants. However, it has been shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 system cleaves genomic DNA sequences containing mismatches to the guide RNA strand. We expected that this low specificity could be exploited to induce multi-homeologous and paralogous gene knockouts. In the case of polyploid plants, simultaneous modification of multiple homeologous genes, i.e., genes with similar but not identical DNA sequences, is often needed to obtain a desired phenotype. Even in diploid plants, disruption of multi-paralogous genes, which have functional redundancy, is often needed. To validate the applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target mutagenesis of paralogous genes in rice, we designed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that recognized 20 base-pair (bp) sequences of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) B2 as an on-target locus. These 20bps possess similarity to other rice CDK genes (CDKA1, CDKA2, CDKB1) with different numbers of mismatches. We analyzed mutations in these 4 CDK genes in plants regenerated from Cas9/sgRNA-transformed calli and revealed that single, double and triple mutants of CDKA2, CDKB1 and CDKB2 can be created by a single sgRNA.
NA	A2-type Cyclin is required for the Asymmetric Entry Division in Rice Stomatal Development.	2018	J Exp Bot	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	In rice, and other major cereal grass crops, stomata are arranged in linear files that parallel to the long growth axis of leaves. Each stomatal unit comprises two dumbbell-shaped guard cells flanked by two subsidiary cells. These morphological and developmental characteristics enable grass stomata response to environmental changes more efficiently. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their cyclin partners coordinate the cell proliferation and differentiation during the development of multicellular organisms. In contrast to animals, plants have many more types and members of cyclins. In Arabidopsis, four A2-type cyclins (CYCA2s) function redundantly in regulating CDKB1 activity to promote the asymmetric division for stomatal initiation and the symmetric division of guard mother cells (GMCs). In this study, we exam the function of the single A2-type cyclin in rice, OsCYCA2;1, as well the single B1-type CDK, OsCDKB1;1. Cross-species complementation tests demonstrated that OsCYCA2;1 and OsCDKB1;1 could complement the defective stomatal phenotypes of Arabidopsis cyca2 and cdkb1 mutants, but also could suppress DNA endoduplication and cell enlargement. While, the early asymmetric divisions that establish the stomatal lineages are often missing within the stomatal cell files of OsCYCA2;1-RNAi rice transgenic lines, leading to a significantly reduced stomatal production. However, GMC divisions are not disrupted either in OsCYCA2;1-RNAi or in OsCDKB1;1-RNAi rice transgenic lines as expected. Our results demonstrate that a conserved but diverged function and behavior of rice A2-type cyclins, which might be associated with the distinct stomatal development pathways between rice and Arabidopsis.
