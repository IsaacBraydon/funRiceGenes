In plants, A- and B-type CDKs are directly involved in cell cycle regulation. B-type CDK (CDKB) is unique to plants; however, only limited information on this kinase has been accumulated thus far. In the present study, we identified a rice cDNA encoding CDKB1;1 and studied its expression in suspension-cultured cells and plant tissues. We found that this enzyme was expressed in actively dividing cells in suspension cultures and was downregulated by the depletion of sucrose from the medium. In plants, the CDKB1;1 transcripts were highly expressed in the shoot and root apical meristems, but not in mature plant organs. These results suggested that CDKB1 is mainly involved in mitotic cell division during plant development.
NA	Multi-gene knockout utilizing off-target mutations of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in rice	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	Plant Genome Engineering Research Unit, Agrogenomics Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, 2-1-2 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602 Japan.	The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) has been demonstrated to be a robust genome engineering tool in a variety of organisms including plants. However, it has been shown that the CRISPR/Cas9 system cleaves genomic DNA sequences containing mismatches to the guide RNA strand. We expected that this low specificity could be exploited to induce multi-homeologous and paralogous gene knockouts. In the case of polyploid plants, simultaneous modification of multiple homeologous genes, i.e., genes with similar but not identical DNA sequences, is often needed to obtain a desired phenotype. Even in diploid plants, disruption of multi-paralogous genes, which have functional redundancy, is often needed. To validate the applicability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target mutagenesis of paralogous genes in rice, we designed a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that recognized 20 base-pair (bp) sequences of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) B2 as an on-target locus. These 20bps possess similarity to other rice CDK genes (CDKA1, CDKA2, CDKB1) with different numbers of mismatches. We analyzed mutations in these 4 CDK genes in plants regenerated from Cas9/sgRNA-transformed calli and revealed that single, double and triple mutants of CDKA2, CDKB1 and CDKB2 can be created by a single sgRNA.
