CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsCYCA2;1	A2-type Cyclin is required for the Asymmetric Entry Division in Rice Stomatal Development.	 Cross-species complementation tests demonstrated that OsCYCA2;1 and OsCDKB1;1 could complement the defective stomatal phenotypes of Arabidopsis cyca2 and cdkb1 mutants, but also could suppress DNA endoduplication and cell enlargement
CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsFLP	Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress in rice.	 Additionally, Yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that OsFLP directly bound to the promoter region of Oryza sativa B-type Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 1;1 (OsCDKB1;1), and the expression of OsCDKB1;1 was repressed in osflp
CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsFLP	Transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of FOUR LIPS in response to salt stress in rice.	 Taken together, our findings reveal a crucial function of OsFLP regulating OsCDKB1;1 in salt tolerance and largely extend the knowledge about the role of OsFLP in rice
CDKB1;1|CDKB1|OsCDKB1;1	OsiICK6|KRP4	The roles of a novel CDKB/KRP/FB3 cell cycle core complex in rice gametes and initiation of embryogenesis.	 In this model, CDKB1, a major regulator of plant mitosis, is a cyclin (CYCD5)-dependent kinase; its activity is coordinately inhibited by two cell cycle inhibitors, KRP4 and KRP5; and both KRPs are regulated via F-box protein 3 (FB3)-mediated proteolysis
