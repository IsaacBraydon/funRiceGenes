Gibberellins (GAs) play important roles in regulating reproductive development, especially anther development. Our previous studies revealed that the MYB transcriptional factor GAMYB, an important component of GA signaling in cereal aleurone cells, is also important for anther development. Here, we examined the physiological functions of GA during anther development through phenotypic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa) GA-deficient, GA-insensitive, and gamyb mutants. The mutants exhibited common defects in programmed cell death (PCD) of tapetal cells and formation of exine and Ubisch bodies. Microarray analysis using anther RNAs of these mutants revealed that rice GAMYB is involved in almost all instances of GA-regulated gene expression in anthers. Among the GA-regulated genes, we focused on two lipid metabolic genes, a cytochrome P450 hydroxylase CYP703A3 and beta-ketoacyl reductase, both of which might be involved in providing a substrate for exine and Ubisch body. GAMYB specifically interacted with GAMYB binding motifs in the promoter regions in vitro, and mutation of these motifs in promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transformants caused reduced GUS expression in anthers. Furthermore, a knockout mutant for CYP703A3 showed gamyb-like defects in exine and Ubisch body formation. Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation.
NA	Identification of cyp703a3-3 and analysis of regulatory role of CYP703A3 in rice anther cuticle and pollen exine development.	2018	Gene	Key Laboratory for Zhejiang Super Rice Research &amp; State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China; National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Anther cuticle and pollen exine are two elaborated lipid-soluble barriers protecting pollen grains from environmental and biological stresses. However, less is known about the mechanisms underlying the synthesis of these lipidic polymers. Here, we identified a no-pollen male-sterility mutant cyp703a3-3 from indica restorer line Zhonghui 8015 (Zh8015) mutant library treated with 60Co¦Ã-ray radiation. Histological analysis indicated that cyp703a3-3 underwent abnormal tapetal cells development, produced few orbicules and secreted less sporopollenin precursors to anther locule, as well as cutin monomers on anther. Genetic analysis revealed that cyp703a3-3 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Map-based cloning was performed to narrow down the mutant gene to a 47.78-kb interval on the chromosome 8 between two markers S15-29 and S15-30. Sequence analysis detected three bases (GAA) deletion in the first exon of LOC_Os08g03682, annotated as CYP703A3 with homologous sequences related to male sterility in Arabidopsis, causing the Asparagine deletion in the mutant site. Moreover, we transformed genomic fragment of CYP703A3 into cyp703a3-3, which male-sterility phenotype was recovered. Both the wild-type and cyp703a3-3 mutant 3D structure of CYP703A3 protein were modeled. Results of qPCR suggested CYP703A3 mainly expressed in anthers with greatest abundance at microspore stage, and genes involved in sporopollenin precursors formation and transportation, such as GAMYB, TDR, CYP704B2, DPW2, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, were significantly reduced in cyp703a3-3. Collectively, our results further elaborated CYP703A3 plays vital role in anther cuticle and pollen exine development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
