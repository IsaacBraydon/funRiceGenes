NA	COG2 negatively regulates chilling tolerance through cell wall components altered in rice	2023	Theor Appl Genet	The Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China.	Chilling-tolerant QTL gene COG2 encoded an extensin and repressed chilling tolerance by affecting the compositions of cell wall. Rice as a major crop is susceptible to chilling stress. Chilling tolerance is a complex trait controlled by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Here, we identify a QTL gene, COG2, that negatively regulates cold tolerance at seedling stage in rice. COG2 overexpression transgenic plants are sensitive to cold, whereas knockout transgenic lines enhance chilling tolerance. Natural variation analysis shows that Hap1 is a specific haplotype in japonica/Geng rice and correlates with chilling tolerance. The SNP1 in COG2 promoter is a specific divergency and leads to the difference in the expression level of COG2 between japonica/Geng and indica/Xian cultivars. COG2 encodes a cell wall-localized extensin and affects the compositions of cell wall, including pectin and cellulose, to defense the chilling stress. The results extend the understanding of the adaptation to the environment and provide an editing target for molecular design breeding of cold tolerance in rice.
