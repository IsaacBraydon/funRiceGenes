Hamanaka-1999-Identification of cD.pdf	Identification of cDNA encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5c (COX5c) from rice. Comparison of its expression with nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded COX genes	1999	Genes Genet Syst	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo 	Little is presently known about the nuclear-encoded genes for cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in higher plants. In rice, only the nuclear-encoded COX5b gene has been reported. To understand the relationship between the expression of nuclear-encoded and mitochondrial-encoded COX genes in rice, we first characterized a cDNA encoding one of the other nuclear COX genes, COX5c, which encodes 63 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of COX5c from rice was highly homologous to that from sweet potato. Genomic Southern hybridization indicated that the rice COX5c subunit is encoded by a single copy of the COX5c gene. Furthermore, we compared the expression patterns of the nuclear-encoded COX5c and COX5b genes with the expression pattern of the mitochondrial-encoded COX1 gene among several organs by Northern blot analysis. The results suggested that regulatory systems of expression between the nuclear-encoded and the mitochondrial-encoded COX genes are different among different organs in rice.
