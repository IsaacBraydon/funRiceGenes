Chloroplasts are also thought to possess a system for generating guanosine 5'-triphosphate ((p)ppGpp), which triggers the stringent response in eubacteria, with genes encoding chloroplastic (p)ppGpp synthetase having been identified. We now describe the identification and characterization of genes (OsCRSH1, OsCRSH2, and OsCRSH3) for a novel type of (p)ppGpp synthetase in rice. The proteins encoded by these genes contain a putative chloroplast transit peptide at the NH(2) terminus, a central RelA-SpoT-like domain, and two EF-hand motifs at the COOH terminus. The recombinant OsCRSH1 protein was imported into chloroplasts in vitro, and genetic complementation analysis revealed that expression of OsCRSH1 suppressed the phenotype of an Escherichia coli mutant deficient in the RelA and SpoT enzymes. Biochemical analysis showed that the OsCRSH proteins possess (p)ppGpp synthetase activity that is dependent both on Ca(2+) and on the EF-hand motifs. A data base search identified a CRSH homolog in the dicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating that such genes are conserved among both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous land plants. CRSH proteins thus likely function as Ca(2+)-activated (p)ppGpp synthetases in plant chloroplasts, implicating both Ca(2+) and (p)ppGpp signaling in regulation of the genetic system of these organelles.
