CLSY1	plant height	An epigenetic pathway in rice connects genetic variation to anaerobic germination and seedling establishment	We propose that truncation of the CLSY1 gene in rice may alter the RNA-guided DNA methylation pathway that leads to enhanced plant height in flooded environments due to changes in methylation profiles and overall changes in gene expression.
