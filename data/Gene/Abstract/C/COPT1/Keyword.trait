COPT1	CxC motif	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice 	The CC motif has been detected in rice COPT1, COPT2, and COPT5 and CxC motif in rice COPT6 and COPT7 at the C-termini (Figure <U+200B>(Figure22).
COPT1	shoot	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice 	Zn deficiency induced COPT1, COPT5, and COPT7 and slightly suppressed COPT4 in root and induced COPT5, COPT6, and COPT7 in shoot. 
COPT1	shoot	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice 	Overexpressing COPT1 or COPT5 or suppressing COPT1 or COPT5 in rice had no influence on Fe, Mn, and Zn contents in rice shoot
COPT1	xylem	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice 	 Rice COPT1, COPT5, and XA13 cooperate to promote removal of Cu from rice xylem vessels, where Xoo multiplies and spreads to cause disease
COPT1	copper accumulation	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice	Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription.
COPT1	viral resistance	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice	Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription.
