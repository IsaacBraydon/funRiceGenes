COPT1	COPT5	Molecular and functional analyses of COPT/Ctr-type copper transporter-like gene family in rice	 However, only two, COPT1 and COPT5, have been characterized for their functions in Cu transport| Among the proteins encoded by rice COPTs, COPT2, COPT3, and COPT4 physically interacted with COPT6, respectively, except for the known interaction between COPT1 and COPT5
