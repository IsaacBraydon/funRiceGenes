CTMyb1|OsTRFL1	development	Telomere association of Oryza sativa telomere repeat-binding factor like 1 and its roles in telomere maintenance and development in rice, Oryza sativa L	 These results suggest that OsTRFL1 is an essential factor for the proper maintenance of telomeres and normal development of rice
CTMyb1|OsTRFL1	vegetative	Telomere association of Oryza sativa telomere repeat-binding factor like 1 and its roles in telomere maintenance and development in rice, Oryza sativa L	 The reduced levels of OsTRFL1 caused serious developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs of rice plants
CTMyb1|OsTRFL1	reproductive	Telomere association of Oryza sativa telomere repeat-binding factor like 1 and its roles in telomere maintenance and development in rice, Oryza sativa L	 The reduced levels of OsTRFL1 caused serious developmental defects in both vegetative and reproductive organs of rice plants
CTMyb1|OsTRFL1	telomere lengthening	Telomere association of Oryza sativa telomere repeat-binding factor like 1 and its roles in telomere maintenance and development in rice, Oryza sativa L	 T-DNA inserted OsTRFL1 knock-out mutant rice plants displayed significantly longer telomeres (6-25 kb) than those (5-12 kb) in wild-type plants, indicating that OsTRFL1 is a negative factor for telomere lengthening
CTMyb1|OsTRFL1	telomere repeat-binding factor	Telomere association of Oryza sativa telomere repeat-binding factor like 1 and its roles in telomere maintenance and development in rice, Oryza sativa L	 In this study, we identified and characterized OsTRFL1 (Oryza sativa Telomere Repeat-binding Factor Like 1) in rice, a monocot model crop
