miR166	RDD1	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.
miR166	RDD1	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.	The transcription factor-encoding gene RDD1 increases the uptake of nutrient ions, photosynthetic activity under ambient and high CO(2) conditions, and grain productivity, and microRNA166 (miR166) regulates its transcript levels
