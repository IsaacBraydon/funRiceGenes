miR166	RDD1	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.
miR166	RDD1	In-frame editing of transcription factor gene RDD1 to suppress miR166 recognition influences nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, and grain quality in rice.	The transcription factor-encoding gene RDD1 increases the uptake of nutrient ions, photosynthetic activity under ambient and high CO(2) conditions, and grain productivity, and microRNA166 (miR166) regulates its transcript levels
miR166	OsDRB2	DRB2 Modulates Leaf Rolling by Regulating Accumulation of MicroRNAs Related to Leaf Development in Rice.	 qRT-PCR analysis of 29 related genes suggested that defects of the OsDRB2-miR166-OsHBs pathway could play an important role in formation of the rolled leaf phenotype of rl89, in which OsDRB2 mutation reduced miR166 accumulation, resulting in elevated expressions of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper genes (such as OsHB1, 3 and 5) involved in leaf polarity and/or morphology development
