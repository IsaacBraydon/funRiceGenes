NA	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	2020	Plant Physiol	China National Rice Research Institute CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	Rice (Oryza sativa) spikelets have a unique inflorescence structure and the mechanisms regulating their development are not yet fully understood. Moreover, approaches to manipulate spikelet development have the potential to increase grain yield. In this study, we identified and characterized a recessive spikelet mutant, namely more floret 1 (mof1). The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs. In addition, the main body of the palea was reduced, and the sterile lemma was enlarged and partially acquired hull (lemma and/or palea) identity. We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect. MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes. Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice. 
NA	MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET 2, a MYB Transcription Factor, Determines Spikelet Meristem Fate and Floral Organ Identity in Rice	2020	Plant Physiol	Southwest University CITY: Chongqing STATE: Chongqing POSTAL_CODE: 400716 China	An understanding of flower and panicle development is crucial for improving yield and quality in majority of grass crops. In this study, we used mapping-based cloning to identify MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET2 (MFS2), which encodes a MYB transcription factor and regulates flower and spikelet development in rice (Oryza sativa). In the mfs2 mutant, specification of palea identity was severely disturbed and showed degradation or transformation into a lemma-like organ, and the number of all floral organs was increased to varying degrees. Due to the increase in the number of floral organs and development of extra transformed palea/marginal region of the palea (mrp)-like organs, some mfs2 spikelets had a tendency to produce two florets. These defects implied that the mfs2 mutation caused abnormal specification of palea identity and partial loss of spikelet determination. We confirm that MFS2 is a transcriptional repressor that shows strong repression activity by means of two typical EAR motifs, one of which locates at the C-terminus and is capable of interaction with three rice TOPLESS and TOPLESS-related protein (TPL/TPR) proteins. The results indicate that MFS2 acts as a repressor that regulates floral organ identities and spikelet meristem determinacy in rice by forming a repression complex with rice TPL/TPR proteins.
