MOF1|MFS2	spikelet	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs
MOF1|MFS2	spikelet	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice
MOF1|MFS2	map-based cloning	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 We used map-based cloning to identify the MOF1 locus and confirmed our identification by complementation and by generating new mof1 alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
MOF1|MFS2	ethylene	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect
MOF1|MFS2	floral	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs
MOF1|MFS2	floral meristem	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 The mof1 mutant has a delayed transition from the spikelet to the floral meristem, inducing the formation of extra lemma-like and palea-like organs
MOF1|MFS2	nucleus	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 MOF1 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINs (TPRs) to possibly repress the expression of downstream target genes
MOF1|MFS2	organ identity	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 Taken together, our results reveal that MOF1 plays an important role in the regulation of organ identity and spikelet determinacy in rice
MOF1|MFS2	ethylene response	MORE FLORET 1 encodes a MYB transcription factor that regulates spikelet development in rice 	 MOF1 encodes a MYB domain protein with the typical ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motifs, is expressed in all organs and tissues, and has a strong repression effect
