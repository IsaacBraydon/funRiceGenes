MetRS|MRS	catalytic potency	A recurrent general RNA binding domain appended to plant methionyl-tRNA synthetase acts as a cis-acting cofactor for aminoacylation 	Therefore, at the concentrations of free, non-aminoacylated tRNA prevailing within the cell (¡«0.1 ¦ÌM), the tRNA binding ability of the EMAPII-like domain significantly improves the catalytic potency of plant MetRS.
