MKRN	seed	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	We isolated RNA from embryonic axes of rice seeds at various stages of imbibition and germination and studied the temporal expression profile of MKRN by RT-PCR
MKRN	seed	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
MKRN	lateral root	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination
MKRN	lateral root	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
MKRN	vegetative	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
MKRN	leaf	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination
MKRN	leaf	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
MKRN	growth	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	The presence of MKRN transcripts in dry seeds, its early induction during germination and its continued spatiotemporal expression during early vegetative growth suggest that MKRN has an important role in germination, leaf and lateral root morphogenesis and overall development in rice
MKRN	root	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	After 6days of germination, an organ-dependent expression pattern of MKRN was observed: highest in roots and moderate in leaves
MKRN	root	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. Japonica) seeds	This analysis revealed that MKRN transcripts were expressed in young plumules, lateral root primordia, leaf primordia, leaves and root tissues at many different stages of germination
MKRN	root	Sequence, expression and tissue localization of a gene encoding a makorin RING zinc-finger protein in germinating rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp.
