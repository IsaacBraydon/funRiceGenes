MKRN	MKRN expression was ubiquitous during early organogenesis in the embryo along the apical-basal and radial axes. The expression of MKRN decreased during embryonic organ elongation and maturation compared to early embryogenesis, but increased again during imbibition. Tissue-specific and position-dependent MKRN expression was found during embryonic and post-embryonic root and shoot development.	NA	NA
MKRN	Also, MKRN was expressed in the various developmental stages of the lateral root primordia and the cells surrounding them. Expression of MKRN was also observed after periclinal division of the presumptive pericycle founder cells.
