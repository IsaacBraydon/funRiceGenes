Toyota-2006-Expression profiling.pdf	Expression profiling of starch metabolism-related plastidic translocator genes in rice	2006	Planta	CREST, Japan Science and Technology Corporation, Omiya, Saitama, Japan.	The genes encoding the major putative rice plastidic translocators involved in the carbon flow related to starch metabolism were identified by exhaustive database searches. The genes identified were two for the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), five for the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) including putatively non-functional ones, four for the phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT), three for the putative ADP-glucose translocator (or Brittle-1 protein, BT1), two for the plastidic nucleotide transport protein (NTT), and one each for the plastidic glucose translocator (pGlcT) and the maltose translocator (MT). The expression patterns of the genes in various photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. OsBT1-1 was specifically expressed in the seed and its transcript level tremendously increased at the onset of vigorous starch production in the endosperm, suggesting that the ADP-glucose synthesized in the cytosol is a major precursor for starch biosynthesis in the endosperm amyloplast. In contrast, all of the genes for OsTPT, OsPPT, and OsNTT were mainly expressed in source tissues, suggesting that their proteins play essential roles in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts. Substantial expression of the four OsGPT genes and the OspGlcT gene in both source and sink organs suggests that the transport of glucose phosphate and glucose is physiologically important in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The present study shows that comprehensive analysis of expression patterns of the plastidic translocator genes is a valuable tool for the elucidation of the functions of the translocators in the regulation of starch metabolism in rice.
NA	Expression and functional analysis of rice plastidic maltose transporter, OsMEX1	2013	Journal of the Korean Society for Applied Biological Chemistry	Graduate School of Biotechnology and Plant Metabolism Research CenterKyung Hee University, Korea	In Arabidopsis, maltose is a major product of the transitory starch degradation pathway at night, and its mobilization from the chloroplasts to the cytosol in leaf tissues via a plastidic maltose transporter, AtMEX1, is essential for normal plant growth. However, such a starch utilization pathway has not yet been characterized in rice (Oryza sativa), a monocot model plant. Examination of expression profiles of a rice plastidic maltose transporter, OsMEX1, by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that it is abundant in the pollen grain-containing stamens of mature flowers. Consistently, high performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a relatively high maltose content in mature flowers, suggesting that OsMEX1 mainly functions in the tissues. OsMEX1-green fluorescent protein fusion experiment confirmed that OsMEX1 localizes at the chloroplast envelope in both rice and Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis maltose excess1 (mex1) mutant was transformed with OsMEX1 fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter. In the resulting transgenic plants, the typical mutant phenotypes of Arabidopsis mex1, such as chlorosis, stunted growth, and maltose and starch deposition at the end of the night, are clearly rescued. This result demonstrates that OsMEX1 functions as a plastidic maltose transporter in Arabidopsis. Our present findings thus suggest that whereas the Arabidopsis MEX1 gene essentially functions in source leaf tissues, its rice counterpart likely has a role in the pollens of mature flowers.
