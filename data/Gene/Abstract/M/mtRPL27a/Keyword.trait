mtRPL27a	pollen	Mitochondrial gene in the nuclear genome induces reproductive barrier in rice	These results demonstrate that the duplicated genes encoding the mtRPL27 protein at S27 and S28 are involved in this pollen sterility, whereas mtRPL27a on S28-T65s is a loss-of-function allele caused by failure of expression (see below).
