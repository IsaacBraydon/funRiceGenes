MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family
MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts
MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria
MPR25	chloroplast	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts
MPR25	chloroplast	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
MPR25	growth	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development
MPR25	chloroplast	AEF1/MPR25 is implicated in RNA editing of plastid atpF and mitochondrial nad5 and also promotes atpF splicing in Arabidopsis and rice.	We also show that splicing of chloroplast atpF transcripts is affected in the rice mpr25 mutant
