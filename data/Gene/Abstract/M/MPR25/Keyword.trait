MPR25	mitochondria	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	 In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family| FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts| Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria| The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts|Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria
MPR25	chloroplast	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	 FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts| The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts
MPR25	growth	Rice MPR25 encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein and is essential for RNA editing of nad5 transcripts in mitochondria	 A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development
