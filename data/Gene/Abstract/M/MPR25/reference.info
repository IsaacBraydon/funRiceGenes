Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in the modification of organelle transcripts. In this study, we investigated the molecular function in rice of the mitochondrial PPR-encoding gene MITOCHONDRIAL PPR25 (MPR25), which belongs to the E subgroup of the PPR family. A Tos17 knockout mutant of MPR25 exhibited growth retardation and pale-green leaves with reduced chlorophyll content during the early stages of plant development. The photosynthetic rate in the mpr25 mutant was significantly decreased, especially under strong light conditions, although the respiration rate did not differ from that of wild-type plants. MPR25 was preferentially expressed in leaves. FLAG-tagged MPR25 accumulated in mitochondria but not in chloroplasts. Direct sequencing revealed that the mpr25 mutant fails to edit a C-U RNA editing site at nucleotide 1580 of nad5, which encodes a subunit of complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) of the respiratory chain in mitochondria. RNA editing of this site is responsible for a change in amino acid from serine to leucine. Recombinant MPR25 directly interacted with the proximal region of the editing site of nad5 transcripts. However, the NADH dehydrogenase activity of complex I was not affected in the mutant. By contrast, genes encoding alternative NADH dehydrogenases and alternative oxidase were up-regulated. The mpr25 mutant may therefore provide new information on the coordinated interaction between mitochondria and chloroplasts.
NA	AEF1/MPR25 is implicated in RNA editing of plastid atpF and mitochondrial nad5 and also promotes atpF splicing in Arabidopsis and rice.	2015	Plant J	Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, 6009, WA, Australia.	RNA editing is an essential mechanism that modifies target cytidines to uridine in both mitochondrial and plastid mRNA. Target sites are recognised by pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins. Using bioinformatics predictions based on the code describing sequence recognition by PPR proteins, we have identified an Arabidopsis editing factor required for the editing of atpF in plastids. A loss of function mutation in ATPF EDITING FACTOR 1 (AEF1, AT3G22150) results in severe variegation, presumably due to decreased plastid ATP synthase levels. Loss of editing at the atpF site is coupled with a large decrease in splicing of the atpF transcript, even though the editing site is within an exon and 53 nucleotides distant from the splice site. The rice orthologue of AEF1, MPR25, has been reported to be required for editing of a site in mitochondrial nad5 transcripts and we confirm that editing of the same site is affected in the Arabidopsis aef1 mutant. We also show that splicing of chloroplast atpF transcripts is affected in the rice mpr25 mutant. AEF1 is thus highly unusual for an RNA editing specificity factor in having functions in both organelles. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
