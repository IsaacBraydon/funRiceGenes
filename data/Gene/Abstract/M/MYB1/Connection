MID1|OsARM1	MYB1	OsARM1, an R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor, Is Involved in Regulation of the Response to Arsenic Stress in Rice.	 Here, we show that the rice R2R3 MYB transcription factor OsARM1 (ARSENITE-RESPONSIVE MYB1) regulates As-associated transporters genes
MYB1	OsHOX24	Genome-wide discovery of OsHOX24-binding sites and regulation of desiccation stress response in rice	 The enrichment of several cis-regulatory motifs representing binding sites of other TFs, such as ABFs, ERF1, MYB1, LTREs and SORLIP2, suggested the involvement of OsHOX24 in a complex regulatory network
