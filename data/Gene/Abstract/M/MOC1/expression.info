Symbol	Expression	Overexpression	RNAi
MOC1	RNA in situ hybridization showed that MOC1 expression could be detected in a small number of epidermal or subepidermal cells at the leaf axils, before any visible morphological changes. Subsequently, MOC1 expression was observed in the small protuberance and axillary meristem, and extended to the entire tiller buds including the axillary leaf primordia and young leaves. In contrast to high-level expression in the axillary meristems, MOC1 expression was undetectable in the shoot apical meristem (SAM).
