MOC1	tiller	Control of tillering in rice	 Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering| The moc1 mutant plants have only a main culm without any tillers owing to a defect in the formation of tiller buds
MOC1	culm	Comparative sequence analysis of MONOCULM1-orthologous regions in 14 Oryza genomes	 A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids
MOC1	culm	Control of tillering in rice	 Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering| The moc1 mutant plants have only a main culm without any tillers owing to a defect in the formation of tiller buds
MOC1	branching	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice	 Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant
MOC1	tillering	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of MOC1 involved in the regulation of rice tillering, we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screening to identify MOC1 interacting proteins (MIPs)| In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
MOC1	axillary meristem	Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	 We show that TE coexpresses with MOC1 in the axil of leaves, where the APC/C(TE) complex mediates the degradation of MOC1 by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway, and consequently downregulates the expression of the meristem identity gene Oryza sativa homeobox 1, thus repressing axillary meristem initiation and formation
MOC1	tiller	Degradation of MONOCULM 1 by APC/C(TAD1) regulates rice tillering	 The MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) gene is the first identified key regulator controlling rice tiller number; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated
MOC1	shoot	Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	Rice MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) and its orthologues LS/LAS (lateral suppressor in tomato and Arabidopsis) are key promoting factors of shoot branching and tillering in higher plants
MOC1	tillering	Control of tillering in rice	 Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering
MOC1	growth	Control of tillering in rice	 MOC1 encodes a putative GRAS family nuclear protein that is expressed mainly in the axillary buds and functions to initiate axillary buds and to promote their outgrowth
