Rice tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits that determine grain yields. Our previous study has demonstrated that the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) gene is a key component that controls the formation of rice tiller buds. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of MOC1 involved in the regulation of rice tillering, we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screening to identify MOC1 interacting proteins (MIPs). Here we reported that MIP1 interacted with MOC1 both in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height. In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering.
Mol. Plant-2011-Yan-319-30.pdf	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice	2011	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement and National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Rice yield and heading date are two distinct traits controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying rice yield traits is important for developing high-yielding rice varieties. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of Ghd8, a major QTL with pleiotropic effects on grain yield, heading date, and plant height. Two sets of near isogenic line populations were developed for the cloning of Ghd8. Ghd8 was narrowed down to a 20-kb region containing two putative genes, of which one encodes the OsHAP3 subunit of a CCAAT-box binding protein (HAP complex); this gene was regarded as the Ghd8 candidate. A complementary test confirmed the identity and pleiotropic effects of the gene; interestingly, the genetic effect of Ghd8 was dependent on its genetic background. By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions. Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant. The ectopic expression of Ghd8 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering by 10 d-a situation similar to the one observed by its homolog AtHAP3b, when compared to wild-type under long-day conditions; these findings indicate the conserved function of Ghd8 and AtHAP3b in flowering in Arabidopsis. Our results demonstrated the important roles of Ghd8 in rice yield formation and flowering, as well as its opposite functions in flowering between rice and Arabidopsis under long-day conditions.
nature01518.pdf	Control of tillering in rice	2003	Nature	Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Tillering in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important agronomic trait for grain production, and also a model system for the study of branching in monocotyledonous plants. Rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that is formed on the unelongated basal internode and grows independently of the mother stem (culm) by means of its own adventitious roots. Rice tillering occurs in a two-stage process: the formation of an axillary bud at each leaf axil and its subsequent outgrowth. Although the morphology and histology and some mutants of rice tillering have been well described, the molecular mechanism of rice tillering remains to be elucidated. Here we report the isolation and characterization of MONOCULM 1 (MOC1), a gene that is important in the control of rice tillering. The moc1 mutant plants have only a main culm without any tillers owing to a defect in the formation of tiller buds. MOC1 encodes a putative GRAS family nuclear protein that is expressed mainly in the axillary buds and functions to initiate axillary buds and to promote their outgrowth.
ncomms1716.pdf	Rice APC/C(TE) controls tillering by mediating the degradation of MONOCULM 1	2012	Nat Commun	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement, Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Rice MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) and its orthologues LS/LAS (lateral suppressor in tomato and Arabidopsis) are key promoting factors of shoot branching and tillering in higher plants. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating MOC1/LS/LAS have remained elusive. Here we show that the rice tiller enhancer (te) mutant displays a drastically increased tiller number. We demonstrate that TE encodes a rice homologue of Cdh1, and that TE acts as an activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex. We show that TE coexpresses with MOC1 in the axil of leaves, where the APC/C(TE) complex mediates the degradation of MOC1 by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway, and consequently downregulates the expression of the meristem identity gene Oryza sativa homeobox 1, thus repressing axillary meristem initiation and formation. We conclude that besides having a conserved role in regulating cell cycle, APC/C(TE) has a unique function in regulating the plant-specific postembryonic shoot branching and tillering, which are major determinants of plant architecture and grain yield.
ncomms1743.pdf	Degradation of MONOCULM 1 by APC/C(TAD1) regulates rice tillering	2012	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	A rice tiller is a specialized grain-bearing branch that contributes greatly to grain yield. The MONOCULM 1 (MOC1) gene is the first identified key regulator controlling rice tiller number; however, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report a novel rice gene, Tillering and Dwarf 1 (TAD1), which encodes a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C), a multi-subunit E3 ligase. Although the elucidation of co-activators and individual subunits of plant APC/C involved in regulating plant development have emerged recently, the understanding of whether and how this large cell-cycle machinery controls plant development is still very limited. Our study demonstrates that TAD1 interacts with MOC1, forms a complex with OsAPC10 and functions as a co-activator of APC/C to target MOC1 for degradation in a cell-cycle-dependent manner. Our findings uncovered a new mechanism underlying shoot branching and shed light on the understanding of how the cell-cycle machinery regulates plant architecture.
PNAS-2009-Lu-0812798106.pdf	Comparative sequence analysis of MONOCULM1-orthologous regions in 14 Oryza genomes	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Comparative genomics is a powerful tool to decipher gene and genome evolution. Placing multiple genome comparisons in a phylogenetic context improves the sensitivity of evolutionary inferences. In the genus Oryza, this comparative approach can be used to investigate gene function, genome evolution, domestication, polyploidy, and ecological adaptation. A large genomic region surrounding the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) locus was chosen for study in 14 Oryza species, including 10 diploids and 4 allotetraploids. Sequencing and annotation of 18 bacterial artificial chromosome clones for these species revealed highly conserved gene colinearity and structure in the MOC1 region. Since the Oryza radiation about 14 Mya, differences in transposon amplification appear to be responsible for the different current sizes of the Oryza genomes. In the MOC1 region, transposons were only conserved between genomes of the same type (e.g., AA or BB). In addition to the conserved gene content, several apparent genes have been generated de novo or uniquely retained in the AA lineage. Two different 3-gene segments have been inserted into the MOC1 region of O. coarctata (KK) or O. sativa by unknown mechanism(s). Large and apparently noncoding sequences flanking the MOC1 gene were observed to be under strong purifying selection. The allotetraploids Oryza alta and Oryza minuta were found to be products of recent polyploidization, less than 1.6 and 0.4 Mya, respectively. In allotetraploids, pseudogenization of duplicated genes was common, caused by large deletions, small frame-shifting insertions/deletions, or nonsense mutations.
NA	Novel function of a putative MOC1 ortholog associated with spikelet number per spike in common wheat.	2015	Sci Rep	National Key Facility for Crop Gene Resources and Genetic Improvement/Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.	Axillary meristems play an important role in determining final plant architecture and floral structures. Tomato Ls, Arabidopsis LAS and rice MOC1 are orthologous genes regulating axillary meristem initiation and outgrowth. Their functions are generally conserved but the functional specificities are divergent among species. Obvious differences between rice panicles and wheat spikes suggest the divergent functions of MOC1 and its wheat ortholog. We show that TaMOC1 might be involved in wheat spikelet development. TaMOC1 is a typical nucleus localized protein with transcriptional activation abilities. The variable N-termini of TaMOC1 protein is necessary for transcriptional activation. TaMOC1 is highly expressed in ears with length of 2, 3 and 6â€‰cm. Significant associations between the TaMOC1-7A haplotype and spikelet number per spike were observed in ten environments over 3 years and 2 sites. TaMOC1-7A HapH, a favored haplotype acquired during wheat polyploidization, may make a positive contribution to spikelet number per spike. Based on evolutionary analysis, geographic distribution and frequency changes, TaMOC1-7A HapH might be associated with wheat domestication and Chinese wheat breeding history. The pyramiding favorable alleles of TaMOC1-7A HapH and TaSnRK2.10 (C, associated with higher TGW) can improve both spikelet number per spike and TGW simultaneously.
NA	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	2019	Mol Plant	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China; State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Tillering in rice is one of the most important agronomic traits. Rice tiller development can be divided into two main processes: the formation of the axillary bud and its subsequent outgrowth. Several genes critical for bud formation in rice have been identified by genetic studies, however, their molecular function and relationships are still largely unknown. Here, we report that MONOCULM1 (MOC1) and MONOCULM 3/TILLERS ABSENT 1/STERILE AND REDUCED TILLERING 1 (MOC3/TAB1/SRT1), two vital regulators for tiller formation in rice, could physically interact to regulate tiller bud outgrowth through upregulating the expression of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER1 (FON1), the homolog of CLAVATA1 in rice. MOC3 could directly bind to the promoter of FON1 and subsequently activate FON1 expression. MOC1 functions as a co-activator of MOC3, which did not directly bind to the FON1 promoter, but could further activate the FON1 expression in the presence of MOC3. Accordingly, FON1 is highly expressed at axillary meristems and shows remarkable decreased expression levels in moc1 and moc3 mutants. Loss-of-function mutants of FON1 exhibit normal bud formation, but deficient bud outgrowth and reduced tiller number. Collectively, these results shed lights on the joint transcriptional regulation by MOC1 and MOC3, and establish a new framework for the control of tiller bud formation and outgrowth.
