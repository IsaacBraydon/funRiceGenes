MIP1	MOC1	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 Here we reported that MIP1 interacted with MOC1 both in vitro and in vivo| In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
Hd5|DTH8|Ghd8|OsHAP3H|LHD1	MOC1	A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice	 Ghd8 up-regulated MOC1, a key gene controlling tillering and branching; this increased the number of tillers, primary and secondary branches, thus producing 50% more grains per plant
