miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsmiR396	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size
miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsGRF8	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	 Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression
miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	OsUCL8	MiR408 Regulates Grain Yield and Photosynthesis via a Phytocyanin Protein.	 Further studies revealed that the cleavage of OsUCL8 by miR408 affects copper homeostasis in the plant cell, which, in turn, affects the abundance of plastocyanin proteins and photosynthesis in rice
