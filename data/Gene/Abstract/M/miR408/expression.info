miR408|OsMIR408	 A miRNA microarray analysis revealed changes to the expression of many miRNAs, including OsmiR408, in the MIM396 plants |  Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size |  Silencing OsmiR408 expression (miR408KO) using CRISPR technology resulted in small grains |  Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression
