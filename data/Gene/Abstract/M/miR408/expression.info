miR408|OsMIR408	 A miRNA microarray analysis revealed changes to the expression of many miRNAs, including OsmiR408, in the MIM396 plants |  Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size |  Silencing OsmiR408 expression (miR408KO) using CRISPR technology resulted in small grains |  Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression
miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	 Here, we report that the elevated expression of a conserved microRNA, OsmiR408, could positively regulate grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa) by increasing panicle branches and grain number |  Spatial and temporal expression analyses showed that OsUCL8 was highly expressed in pistils, young panicles, developing seeds, and inflorescence meristem and was nearly complementary to that of OsmiR408
miR408|OsMIR408|OsmiR408	 Utilizing mutants of OsMIR408 and OsMIR528, we find that knocking out a single miRNA can result in expression profile changes of many other seemingly unrelated miRNAs
