NA	Overexpression of Os-microRNA408 enhances drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass	2020	Physiol Plant	College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	As a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family in plants, miR408 is known to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, including drought. Interestingly, some studies indicated a species- and/or cultivar-specific drought-responsive characteristic of miR408 in plant drought stress. Moreover, the functions of miR408 in perennial grass species are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR408 in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) by withholding water for 10 days for both wild type and transgenic plants with heterologous expression of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) miR408 gene, Os-miR408. The results showed that transgenic perennial ryegrass plants displayed morphological changes under normal growth conditions, such as curl leaves and sunken stomata, which could be related to decreased leaf water loss. Moreover, transgenic perennial ryegrass exhibited improved drought tolerance, as demonstrated by maintaining higher leaf relative water content (RWC), lower electrolyte leakage (EL) and less lipid peroxidation compared to WT plants under drought stress. Furthermore, the transgenic plants showed higher antioxidative capacity under drought. These results showed that the improved drought tolerance in Os-miR408 transgenic plants could be due to leaf morphological changes favoring the maintenance of water status and to increased antioxidative capacity protecting against the reactive oxygen species damages under stress. These findings implied that miR408 could serve as a potential target for genetic manipulations to engineer perennial grass plants for improved water stress tolerance.
NA	OsmiR396/Growth Regulating Factor modulate rice grain size through direct regulation of embryo-specific miR408	2021	Plant Physiol	Key Laboratory of Insect Developmental and Evolutionary Biology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200032, China.	microRNAs (miRNAs) are promising targets for crop improvement of complex agricultural traits. Coordinated activity between/among different miRNAs may fine-tune specific developmental processes in diverse organisms. Grain size is a main factor determining rice (Oryza sativa L.) crop yield, but the network of miRNAs influencing this trait remains uncharacterized. Here we show that sequestering OsmiR396 through target mimicry (MIM396) can substantially increase grain size in several japonica and indica rice subspecies and in plants with excessive tillers and a high panicle density. Thus, OsmiR396 has a major role related to the regulation of rice grain size. The grain shape of Growth Regulating Factor8 (OsGRF8)-overexpressing transgenic plants was most similar to that of MIM396 plants, suggesting OsGRF8 is a major mediator of OsmiR396 in grain size regulation. A miRNA microarray analysis revealed changes to the expression of many miRNAs, including OsmiR408, in the MIM396 plants. Analyses of gene expression patterns and functions indicated OsmiR408 is an embryo-specific miRNA that positively regulates grain size. Silencing OsmiR408 expression (miR408KO) using CRISPR technology resulted in small grains. Moreover, we revealed the direct regulatory effects of OsGRF8 on OsMIR408 expression. A genetic analysis further showed that the large-grain phenotype of MIM396 plants could be complemented by miR408KO. Also, several hormone signaling pathways might be involved in the OsmiR396/GRF-meditated grain size regulation. Our findings suggest that genetic regulatory networks comprising various miRNAs, such as OsmiR396 and OsmiR408, may be crucial for controlling rice grain size. Furthermore, the OsmiR396/GRF module may be important for breeding new high-yielding rice varieties.
