NA	Overexpression of Os-microRNA408 enhances drought tolerance in perennial ryegrass	2020	Physiol Plant	College of Grassland Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.	As a conserved microRNA (miRNA) family in plants, miR408 is known to be involved in different abiotic stress responses, including drought. Interestingly, some studies indicated a species- and/or cultivar-specific drought-responsive characteristic of miR408 in plant drought stress. Moreover, the functions of miR408 in perennial grass species are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR408 in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) by withholding water for 10 days for both wild type and transgenic plants with heterologous expression of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) miR408 gene, Os-miR408. The results showed that transgenic perennial ryegrass plants displayed morphological changes under normal growth conditions, such as curl leaves and sunken stomata, which could be related to decreased leaf water loss. Moreover, transgenic perennial ryegrass exhibited improved drought tolerance, as demonstrated by maintaining higher leaf relative water content (RWC), lower electrolyte leakage (EL) and less lipid peroxidation compared to WT plants under drought stress. Furthermore, the transgenic plants showed higher antioxidative capacity under drought. These results showed that the improved drought tolerance in Os-miR408 transgenic plants could be due to leaf morphological changes favoring the maintenance of water status and to increased antioxidative capacity protecting against the reactive oxygen species damages under stress. These findings implied that miR408 could serve as a potential target for genetic manipulations to engineer perennial grass plants for improved water stress tolerance.
