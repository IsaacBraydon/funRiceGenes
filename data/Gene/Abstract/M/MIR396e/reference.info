NA	Mutations in MIR396e and MIR396f increase grain size and modulate shoot architecture in rice.	2019	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Subtropical Silviculture, Zhejiang A&amp;F University, Lin'an, Hangzhou, 311300, China.	Grain size and plant architecture are critical factors determining crop productivity. Here, we performed gene editing of the MIR396 gene family in rice, and found that MIR396e and MIR396f are two important regulators of grain size and plant architecture. mir396ef mutations can increase grain yield by increasing grain size. In addition, mir396ef mutations resulted in an altered plant architecture, with lengthened leaves but shortened internodes, especially the uppermost internode. Our research suggests that mir396ef mutations promote leaf elongation by increasing the level of a gibberellin (GA) precursor, mevalonic acid (MVA), which subsequently promotes GA biosynthesis. However, internode elongation in mir396ef mutants appears to be suppressed via reduced CYP96B4 expression but not via the GA pathway. This research provides candidate gene-editing targets to breed elite rice varieties. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
