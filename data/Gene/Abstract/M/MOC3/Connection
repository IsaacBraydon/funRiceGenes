MOC1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.
MOC1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 MOC1 functions as a co-activator of MOC3, which did not directly bind to the FON1 promoter, but could further activate the FON1 expression in the presence of MOC3
MOC1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 Accordingly, FON1 is highly expressed at axillary meristems and shows remarkable decreased expression levels in moc1 and moc3 mutants
MOC1	MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Tiller Bud Formation Regulators MOC3 and MOC1 Cooperatively Promote Tiller Bud Outgrowth by Activating FON1 Expression in Rice.	 Collectively, these results shed lights on the joint transcriptional regulation by MOC1 and MOC3, and establish a new framework for the control of tiller bud formation and outgrowth
