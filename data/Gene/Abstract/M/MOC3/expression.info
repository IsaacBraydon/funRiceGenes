MOC3	 The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	 In addition, misexpression of TAB1 under the promoter of FON1 led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that TAB1 is not a positive regulator of stem cells
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	Changes in the expression pattern of OsWUS negatively regulate plant stature and panicle development in rice. |  OsWUS have distinct functions in meristem development with slightly tuned expression |  However, the mechanisms regulating the specific expression of OsWUS need to be further explored |  In this study, an abnormal expression mutant of OsWUS, called Dwarf and aberrant panicle 1 (Dap1) were used |  The expression of OsWUS was markedly increased in Dap1 mutant plants compared to the wild-type, which might be due to a disruption in the genomic sequence integrity |  Our results suggest that OsWUS is a precise regulatory element, its specific spatio-temporal expression pattern is critical for its function, and both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations lead to abnormal plant growth
