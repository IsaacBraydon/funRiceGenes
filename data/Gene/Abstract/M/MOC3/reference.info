NA	MONOCULM 3, an Ortholog of WUSCHEL in Rice, Is Required for Tiller Bud Formation.	2015	J Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research (Beijing), Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	WUSCHEL (WUS) plays an essential role for the maintenance of meristem activity in dicots, but its function is still elusive in monocots. We isolated a new monoculm mutant, monoculm 3 (moc3), in which a point mutation causes the premature termination of rice O. sativa WUS (OsWUS). Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3. MOC3 was localized in the nuclear and could interact with TOPLESS-RELATED PROTEINS (TPRs). The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs. Our results suggest that MOC3 is required for the formation of axillary buds and has a complex relationship with cytokinins.
NA	Axillary Meristem Formation in Rice Requires the WUSCHEL Ortholog TILLERS ABSENT1.	2015	Plant Cell	Department of Biological Sciences, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan Department of Integrated Bioscience, Graduate School of Frontier Science, University of Tokyo, Kashiwa-shi, Chiba, Tokyo 277-8562, Japan.	Axillary shoot formation is a key determinant of plant architecture. Formation of the axillary shoot is regulated by initiation of the axillary meristem or outgrowth of the axillary bud. Here, we show that rice (Oryza sativa) TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1; also known as Os WUS), an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana WUS, is required to initiate axillary meristem development. We found that formation of the axillary meristem in rice proceeds via a transient state, which we term the premeristem, characterized by the expression of OSH1, a marker of indeterminate cells in the shoot apical meristem. In the tab1-1 (wus-1) mutant, however, formation of the axillary meristem is arrested at various stages of the premeristem zone, and OSH1 expression is highly reduced. TAB1/WUS is expressed in the premeristem zone, where it shows a partially overlapping pattern with OSH1. It is likely, therefore, that TAB1 plays an important role in maintaining the premeristem zone and in promoting the formation of the axillary meristem by promoting OSH1 expression. Temporal expression patterns of WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 (WOX4) indicate that WOX4 is likely to regulate meristem maintenance instead of TAB1 after establishment of the axillary meristem. Lastly, we show that the prophyll, the first leaf in the secondary axis, is formed from the premeristem zone and not from the axillary meristem.
NA	Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.	2016	G3 (Bethesda)	Fujian Agriculture &amp; Forestry University;	OsWUS has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice. The OsWUS protein consists of three conserved structural domains, but their biological functions are still unclear. We discovered a new rice mutant resulting from tissue culture, which hardly produced tillers and exhibited complete female sterility. The male and female floral organs of the mutant were morphologically indistinguishable from those of the wild type. We named the mutant srt1 for completely sterile and reduced tillering 1. Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in OsWUS Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of OsWUS (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of OsWUS, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of OsWUS. However, the mutant phenotypes (monoculm and female sterility) displayed in srt1 were as typical and severe as those in tab1-1 and moc3-1 This indicates that the homeobox domain of SRT1 is essential for the regulation of tillering and sterility in rice. In addition, srt1 showed an opposite effect on panicle development to that of the two null allelic mutants, implying that the srt1 protein might still have partial or even new functions on panicle development. The results of this study suggest that the homeobox domain is pivotal for OsWUS function.
NA	TILLERS ABSENT1, the WUSCHEL ortholog, is not involved in stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem in rice.	2019	Plant Signal Behav	a Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science , The University of Tokyo , Tokyo , Japan.	Stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is very important for plant development and is regulated by the WUSCHEL-CLAVATA (WUS-CLV) feedback loop in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). WUS promotes stem cell identity, whereas CLV negatively regulates stem cell proliferation by repressing WUS expression. We previously showed that, in rice (Oryza sativa), the WUS ortholog TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1, also known as OsWUS) has no function in SAM maintenance, whereas it plays a crucial role in axillary meristem development. Recently, we showed that a double mutant of FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and ABERRANT SPIKELET AND PANICLE1 (ASP1) led to a marked enlargement of the inflorescence meristem, and that the TAB1 function is not associated with massive stem cells in this meristem. In this paper, we confirmed that TAB1 is also unrelated to the enlargement of the SAM in the vegetative phase of the fon2 and fon2 asp1 mutants. In addition, misexpression of TAB1 under the promoter of FON1 led to a slight reduction of the SAM size in wild type, suggesting that TAB1 is not a positive regulator of stem cells. Taking together, TAB1 seems not to be involved in meristem maintenance, irrespective of the meristem type.
NA	Antagonistic action of TILLERS ABSENT1 and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 regulates stem cell maintenance during axillary meristem development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	Department of Biological Sciences, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8654, Japan.	Shoot branches are formed from the axillary meristem and their formation is a key process in plant development. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is progressing, our knowledge of these mechanisms during the process of axillary meristem development is insufficient. To elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying axillary meristem development in rice (Oryza sativa), we undertook a molecular genetic analysis focusing on TILLERS ABSENT1 (TAB1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2), respective orthologs of the WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3 genes involved in SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We revealed that stem cells were established at an early stage of axillary meristem development in wild type, but were not maintained in tab1. By contrast, the stem cell region and TAB1 expression domain were expanded in fon2, and FON2 overexpression inhibited axillary meristem formation. These results indicate that TAB1 is required to maintain stem cells during axillary meristem development, whereas FON2 negatively regulates stem cell fate by restricting TAB1 expression. Thus, the genetic pathway regulating SAM maintenance in Arabidopsis seems to have been recruited to play a specific role within a narrow developmental window - namely, axillary meristem establishment - in rice.
