MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	tiller	MONOCULM 3, an Ortholog of WUSCHEL in Rice, Is Required for Tiller Bud Formation.	 Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	cytokinin	MONOCULM 3, an Ortholog of WUSCHEL in Rice, Is Required for Tiller Bud Formation.	 The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs

MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	development	Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.	OsWUS has recently been shown to be a transcription factor gene critical for tiller development and fertility in rice
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	map-based cloning	Homeobox Is Pivotal for OsWUS Controlling Tiller Development and Female Fertility in Rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed that the mutant phenotypes were caused by a mutation in OsWUS Compared with the two previously reported null allelic mutants of OsWUS (tab1-1 and moc3-1), which could produce partial N-terminal peptides of OsWUS, the srt1 protein contained a deletion of only seven amino acids within the conserved homeobox domain of OsWUS
