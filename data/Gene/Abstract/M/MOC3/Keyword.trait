MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	tiller	MONOCULM 3, an Ortholog of WUSCHEL in Rice, Is Required for Tiller Bud Formation.	 Morphological observation revealed that the formation of tiller buds was disrupted in moc3
MOC3|OsWUS|TAB1|OsTAB1	cytokinin	MONOCULM 3, an Ortholog of WUSCHEL in Rice, Is Required for Tiller Bud Formation.	 The expression of MOC3 was induced by cytokinins and defection of MOC3 affected the expression of several two-component cytokinin response regulators, OsRRs and ORRs
