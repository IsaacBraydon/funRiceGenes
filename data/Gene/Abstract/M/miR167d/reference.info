NA	miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.	2022	Rice (N Y)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Gene Exploration and Utilization in Southwest China, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu, 611130, China.	Flower opening and stigma exertion are two critical traits for cross-pollination during seed production of hybrid rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this study, we demonstrate that the miR167d-ARFs module regulates stigma size and flower opening that is associated with the elongation of stamen filaments and the cell arrangement of lodicules. The overexpression of miR167d (OX167d) resulted in failed elongation of stamen filaments, increased stigma size, and morphological alteration of lodicule, resulting in cleistogamy. Blocking miR167d by target mimicry also led to a morphological alteration of the individual floral organs, including a reduction in stigma size and alteration of lodicule cell morphology, but did not show the cleistogamous phenotype. In addition, the four target genes of miR167d, namely ARF6, ARF12, ARF17, and ARF25, have overlapping functions in flower opening and stigma size. The loss-of-function of a single ARF gene did not influence the flower opening and stigma size, but arf12 single mutant showed a reduced plant height and aborted apical spikelets. However, mutation in ARF12 together with mutation in either ARF6, ARF17, or ARF25 led to the same defective phenotypes that were observed in OX167d, including the failed elongation of stamen filaments, increased stigma size, and morphological alteration of lodicule. These findings indicate that the appropriate expression of miR167d is crucial and the miR167d-ARFs module plays important roles in the regulation of flower opening and stigma size in rice.
