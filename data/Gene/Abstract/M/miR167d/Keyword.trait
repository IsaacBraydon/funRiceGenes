miR167d	flower	miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.	 These findings indicate that the appropriate expression of miR167d is crucial and the miR167d-ARFs module plays important roles in the regulation of flower opening and stigma size in rice
miR167d	floral	miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.	 Blocking miR167d by target mimicry also led to a morphological alteration of the individual floral organs, including a reduction in stigma size and alteration of lodicule cell morphology, but did not show the cleistogamous phenotype
miR167d	stamen	miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.	 The overexpression of miR167d (OX167d) resulted in failed elongation of stamen filaments, increased stigma size, and morphological alteration of lodicule, resulting in cleistogamy
miR167d	floral organ	miR167d-ARFs Module Regulates Flower Opening and Stigma Size in Rice.	 Blocking miR167d by target mimicry also led to a morphological alteration of the individual floral organs, including a reduction in stigma size and alteration of lodicule cell morphology, but did not show the cleistogamous phenotype
