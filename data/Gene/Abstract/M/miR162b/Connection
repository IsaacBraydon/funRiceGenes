miR162b	OsABA1|OSZEP1	Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.	 Among them, miR1425-5P, miR169a, miR169n, miR390-5P, miR397a and miR397b were up-regulated, but miR162b reduced in expression in Osaba1
miR162b	OsTRE1	Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.	 Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1
