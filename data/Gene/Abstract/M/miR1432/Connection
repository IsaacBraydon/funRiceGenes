miR1432	OsEFH1	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 miR1432 suppresses the expression of LOC_Os03g59790, which encodes an EF-hand family protein 1 (OsEFH1)
miR1432	OsEFH1	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Further study revealed that miR1432 and OsEFH1 are differentially responsive to chitin, a fungus-derived pathogen/microbe-associated molecular pattern (PAMP/MAMP)
miR1432	OsEFH1	Rice miR1432 Fine-Tunes the Balance of Yield and Blast Disease Resistance via Different Modules.	 Consistently, blocking miR1432 or overexpression of OsEFH1 improves chitin-triggered immunity responses
