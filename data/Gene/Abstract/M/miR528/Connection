AGO18|OsAGO18	miR528	Jasmonate Signaling Enhances RNA Silencing and Antiviral Defense in Rice.	 Here, we show that jasmonate (JA) signaling transcriptionally activates Argonaute 18 (AGO18), a core RNA silencing component that promotes rice antiviral defense through sequestering miR168 and miR528, which repress key antiviral defense proteins
D3	miR528	The miR528-D3 Module Regulates Plant Height in Rice by Modulating the Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid Metabolisms.	 In recent years, plant height-related genes have been characterized and identified, among which the DWARF3 (D3) gene is one of the target genes of miR528, and regulates rice plant height and tillering mainly by affecting strigolactone (SL) signal transduction
D3	miR528	The miR528-D3 Module Regulates Plant Height in Rice by Modulating the Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid Metabolisms.	 However, it remains unknown whether the miR528 and D3 interaction functions in controlling plant height, and the underlying regulatory mechanism in rice
D3	miR528	The miR528-D3 Module Regulates Plant Height in Rice by Modulating the Gibberellin and Abscisic Acid Metabolisms.	 In this study, we found that the plant height, internode length, and cell length of internodes of d3 mutants and miR528-overexpressing (OE-miR528) lines were greatly shorter than WT, D3-overexpressing (OE-D3), and miR528 target mimicry (OE-MIM528) transgenic plants
COPT1	miR528	The key micronutrient copper orchestrates broad-spectrum virus resistance in rice.	 Loss-of-function mutations in HMA5, COPT1, and COPT5 caused a significant reduction in copper accumulation and plant viral resistance because of the increased SPL9-mediated miR528 transcription
