AGO18|OsAGO18	miR528	Jasmonate Signaling Enhances RNA Silencing and Antiviral Defense in Rice.	 Here, we show that jasmonate (JA) signaling transcriptionally activates Argonaute 18 (AGO18), a core RNA silencing component that promotes rice antiviral defense through sequestering miR168 and miR528, which repress key antiviral defense proteins
