miR156f	tiller	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 In contrast, plants over-expression a miR156f target mimic (MIM156fOE) had a reduced tiller number and increased height
miR156f	architecture	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
miR156f	height	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 In contrast, plants over-expression a miR156f target mimic (MIM156fOE) had a reduced tiller number and increased height
miR156f	tiller number	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 In contrast, plants over-expression a miR156f target mimic (MIM156fOE) had a reduced tiller number and increased height
miR156f	plant architecture	Modulation of plant architecture by the miR156f-OsSPL7-OsGH3.8 pathway in rice.	 Genetic analysis showed that OsSPL7 is a target of miR156f that regulates plant architecture
