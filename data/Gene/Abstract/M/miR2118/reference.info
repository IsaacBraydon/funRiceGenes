NA	miR2118-dependent U-rich phasiRNA production in rice anther wall development.	2020	Nat Commun	Science and Technology Group, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), 1919-1 Tancha, Onna-son, Okinawa, 904-0495, Japan.	Reproduction-specific small RNAs are vital regulators of germline development in  animals and plants. MicroRNA2118 (miR2118) is conserved in plants and induces the production of phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). To reveal the biological functions of miR2118, we describe here rice mutants with large deletions of the miR2118 cluster. Our results demonstrate that the loss of miR2118 causes severe male and female sterility in rice, associated with marked morphological and developmental abnormalities in somatic anther wall cells. Small RNA profiling reveals that miR2118-dependent 21-nucleotide (nt) phasiRNAs in the anther wall are U-rich, distinct from the phasiRNAs in germ cells. Furthermore, the miR2118-dependent biogenesis of 21-nt phasiRNAs may involve the Argonaute proteins OsAGO1b/OsAGO1d, which are abundant in anther wall cell layers. Our study highlights the site-specific differences of phasiRNAs between somatic anther wall and germ cells, and demonstrates the significance of miR2118/U-phasiRNA functions in anther wall development and rice reproduction.
NA	Mobile ARGONAUTE 1d binds 22-nt miRNAs to generate phasiRNAs important for low-temperature male fertility in rice.	2022	Sci China Life Sci	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) are abundantly expressed in anthers and linked to environment-related male fertility in grasses, yet how they function under different environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) low temperature-induced Argonaute (AGO) protein, OsAGO1d, that is responsible for generating phasiRNAs and preserving male fertility at low temperature. Loss of OsAGO1d function causes low-temperature male sterility associated with delayed programmed cell death of tapetal cells during anther development. OsAGO1d binds miR2118 and miR2275 family members and triggers phasiRNA biogenesis; it also binds 21-nt phasiRNAs with a 5&#x27; terminal U. In total, phasiRNAs from 972 loci are OsAGO1d-dependent. OsAGO1d protein moves from anther wall cells into meiocytes, where it loads miR2275 to produce 24-nt phasiRNAs. Together, our results show that OsAGO1d acts as a mobile signal to fine-tune phasiRNA production and this function is important for male fertility at low temperature.
