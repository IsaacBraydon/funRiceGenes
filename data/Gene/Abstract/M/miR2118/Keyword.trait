miR2118	anther	miR2118-dependent U-rich phasiRNA production in rice anther wall development.	 Our results demonstrate that the loss of miR2118 causes severe male and female sterility in rice, associated with marked morphological and developmental abnormalities in somatic anther wall cells
miR2118	sterility	miR2118-dependent U-rich phasiRNA production in rice anther wall development.	 Our results demonstrate that the loss of miR2118 causes severe male and female sterility in rice, associated with marked morphological and developmental abnormalities in somatic anther wall cells
miR2118	male sterility	miR2118-dependent U-rich phasiRNA production in rice anther wall development.	 Our results demonstrate that the loss of miR2118 causes severe male and female sterility in rice, associated with marked morphological and developmental abnormalities in somatic anther wall cells
