MHZ11	OsCTR2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 Genetically, MHZ11 acts at the ethylene receptor OsERS2 upstream of OsCTR2 and OsEIN2
MHZ11	OsCTR2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 MHZ11 mutation maintains more OsCTR2 in phosphorylated form whereas MHZ11 overexpression promotes ethylene inhibition of OsCTR2 phosphorylation
MHZ11	OsCTR2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 MHZ11 co-localized with the ethylene receptor OsERS2, and its effect on OsCTR2 phosphorylation requires ethylene perception and signaling initiation
MHZ11	OsCTR2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 Blocking sterol biosynthesis partially rescued mhz11 ethylene response likely by reducing receptor-OsCTR2 interaction and OsCTR2 phosphorylation
MHZ11	OsCTR2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 We propose that MHZ11 works to reduce sterol level to impair receptor-OsCTR2 interaction and OsCTR2 phosphorylation for triggering of signaling upon ethylene treatment
MHZ11	OsEIN2	The GDSL Lipase MHZ11 Modulates Ethylene Signaling in Rice Roots.	 Genetically, MHZ11 acts at the ethylene receptor OsERS2 upstream of OsCTR2 and OsEIN2
