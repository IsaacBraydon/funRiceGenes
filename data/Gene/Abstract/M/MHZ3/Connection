MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.
MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 MHZ3 physically interacts with OsEIN2, and both the N- and C-termini of MHZ3 specifically associate with the OsEIN2 Nramp-like domain
MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 Loss ofmhz3function reduces OsEIN2 abundance and attenuates ethylene-induced OsEIN2 accumulation, whereasMHZ3overexpression elevates the abundance of both wild-type and mutated OsEIN2 proteins, suggesting that MHZ3 is required for proper accumulation of OsEIN2 protein
MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 The association of MHZ3 with the Nramp-like domain is crucial for OsEIN2 accumulation, demonstrating the significance of the OsEIN2 transmembrane domains in ethylene signaling
MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 Moreover, MHZ3 negatively modulates OsEIN2 ubiquitination, protecting OsEIN2 from proteasome-mediated degradation
MHZ3	OsEIN2	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 Together, these results suggest that ethylene-induced MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 likely by binding to its Nramp-like domain and impeding protein ubiquitination to facilitate ethylene signal transduction
