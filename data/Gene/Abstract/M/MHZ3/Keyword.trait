MHZ3	ethylene	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 The association of MHZ3 with the Nramp-like domain is crucial for OsEIN2 accumulation, demonstrating the significance of the OsEIN2 transmembrane domains in ethylene signaling
MHZ3	ethylene	Membrane protein MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 in rice by interacting with its Nramp-like domain.	 Together, these results suggest that ethylene-induced MHZ3 stabilizes OsEIN2 likely by binding to its Nramp-like domain and impeding protein ubiquitination to facilitate ethylene signal transduction
