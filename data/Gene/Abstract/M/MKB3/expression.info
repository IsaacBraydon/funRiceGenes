MKB3	Expression analysis revealed thatMKB3is predominantly expressed on the epidermis of leaf primordia, which is different from the case ofAN3A protein movement assay demonstrated that MKB3 moves from anMKB3-expressing domain to a non-expressing domain, which is required for normal leaf development |  However, the expression pattern ofMKB3and direction of protein movement are different between rice and Arabidopsis, which might reflect differences in leaf primordia development in these two species
