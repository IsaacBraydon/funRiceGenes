MKB3	leaf	Conserved functional control, but distinct regulation of cell proliferation in rice and Arabidopsis leaves revealed by comparative analysis ofGRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1orthologs.	Expression analysis revealed thatMKB3is predominantly expressed on the epidermis of leaf primordia, which is different from the case ofAN3A protein movement assay demonstrated that MKB3 moves from anMKB3-expressing domain to a non-expressing domain, which is required for normal leaf development
