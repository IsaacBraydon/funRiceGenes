NA	Conserved functional control, but distinct regulation of cell proliferation in rice and Arabidopsis leaves revealed by comparative analysis ofGRF-INTERACTING FACTOR 1orthologs.	2018	Development	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Regulation of cell proliferation is critical for establishing the shape of plant leaves. We identifiedMAKIBA3(MKB3), a loss-of-function mutant of which in rice exhibited a narrowed- and rolled-leaf phenotype.MKB3was found to be an ortholog of ArabidopsisANGUSTIFOLIA3(AN3), which positively regulates cell proliferation. The reduced leaf size ofmkb3plants with enlarged cells and the increased size ofMKB3-overexpressing leaves with normal-sized cells indicate thatMKB3is a positive regulator of leaf proliferation and thatmkb3mutation triggered a compensation syndrome, as in Arabidopsisan3.Expression analysis revealed thatMKB3is predominantly expressed on the epidermis of leaf primordia, which is different from the case ofAN3A protein movement assay demonstrated that MKB3 moves from anMKB3-expressing domain to a non-expressing domain, which is required for normal leaf development. Our results suggest that riceMKB3and ArabidopsisAN3have conserved functions and effects on leaf development. However, the expression pattern ofMKB3and direction of protein movement are different between rice and Arabidopsis, which might reflect differences in leaf primordia development in these two species.
