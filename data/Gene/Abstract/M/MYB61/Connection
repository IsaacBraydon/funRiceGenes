IIP4	MYB61|OsMYB61	An uncanonical CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein represses secondary wall synthesis and controls mechanical strength in rice.	 Gene expression and transactivation activity assays revealed that IIP4 negatively regulates expression of MYB61 and CESAs without binding to the promoters of these genes
MYB61|OsMYB61	OsSND2	OsSND2, a NAC family transcription factor, is involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis through regulating MYBs expression in rice	We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) to  further confirm that OsSND2 can directly bind to the promoter of OsMYB61 both in  vitro and in vivo
MYB61|OsMYB61	OSH1|Oskn1	The OsbHLH002/OsICE1-OSH1 module orchestrates secondary cell wall formation in rice.	 In addition, the DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1, rice ortholog of KNOTTED ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA7, and OsNAC31 interact with OsbHLH002 and OSH1 and regulate their binding capacity on OsMYB61, a key regulatory factor in SCW development
