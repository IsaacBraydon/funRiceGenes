NA	A Gibberellin-Mediated DELLA-NAC Signaling Cascade Regulates Cellulose Synthesis in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	Cellulose, which can be converted into numerous industrial products, has important impacts on the global economy. It has long been known that cellulose synthesis in plants is tightly regulated by various phytohormones. However, the underlying mechanism of cellulose synthesis regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that in rice (Oryza sativa), gibberellin (GA) signals promote cellulose synthesis by relieving the interaction between SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1), a DELLA repressor of GA signaling, and NACs, the top-layer transcription factors for secondary wall formation. Mutations in GA-related genes and physiological treatments altered the transcription of CELLULOSE SYNTHASE genes (CESAs) and the cellulose level. Multiple experiments demonstrated that transcription factors NAC29/31 and MYB61 are CESA regulators in rice; NAC29/31 directly regulates MYB61, which in turn activates CESA expression. This hierarchical regulation pathway is blocked by SLR1-NAC29/31 interactions. Based on the results of anatomical analysis and GA content examination in developing rice internodes, this signaling cascade was found to be modulated by varied endogenous GA levels and to be required for internode development. Genetic and gene expression analyses were further performed in Arabidopsis thaliana GA-related mutants. Altogether, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism by which GA regulates secondary wall cellulose synthesis in land plants and provide a strategy for manipulating cellulose production and plant growth.
NA	MYB61 is regulated by GRF4 and promotes nitrogen utilization and biomass production in rice	2020	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, The Innovative Academy of Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 100101, Beijing, China.	Nitrogen (N) is a macronutrient that boosts carbon (C) metabolism and plant growth leading to biomass accumulation. The molecular connection between nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) and biomass production remains unclear. Here, via quantitative trait loci analysis and map-based cloning, we reveal that natural variation at the MYB61 locus leads to differences in N use and cellulose biogenesis between indica and japonica subspecies of rice. MYB61, a transcriptional factor that regulates cellulose synthesis, is directly regulated by a known NUE regulator GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR4 (GRF4), which coordinates cellulosic biomass production and N utilization. The variation at MYB61 has been selected during indica and japonica domestication. The indica allele of MYB61 displays robust transcription resulting in higher NUE and increased grain yield at reduced N supply than that of japonica. Our study hence unravels how C metabolism is linked to N uptake and may provide an opportunity to reduce N use for sustainable agriculture.
