MEICA1	meiotic	MEICA 1 (meiotic chromosome association 1) interacts with TOP3α and regulates meiotic recombination in rice.	 Thus, our data establish two pivotal roles for MEICA1 in meiosis: preventing aberrant meiotic recombination and regulating crossover formation
MEICA1	crossover	MEICA 1 (meiotic chromosome association 1) interacts with TOP3α and regulates meiotic recombination in rice.	 In addition, MEICA1 has an anti-crossover activity revealed by suppressing the defects of crossover formation in msh5 meica1 compared with that in msh5, showing the similar function with its interacted protein TOP3α
MEICA1	crossover	MEICA 1 (meiotic chromosome association 1) interacts with TOP3α and regulates meiotic recombination in rice.	 Thus, our data establish two pivotal roles for MEICA1 in meiosis: preventing aberrant meiotic recombination and regulating crossover formation
MEICA1	meiotic recombination	MEICA 1 (meiotic chromosome association 1) interacts with TOP3α and regulates meiotic recombination in rice.	 Thus, our data establish two pivotal roles for MEICA1 in meiosis: preventing aberrant meiotic recombination and regulating crossover formation
