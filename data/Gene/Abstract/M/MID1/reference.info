NA	MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.	2016	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Institute of Plant Biology, Center for Evolutionary Biology, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, 2005 Songhu Road, Shanghai, 200438, China.	Drought during rice reproductive development results in yield loss. It is important to understand the functions of drought-responsive genes in reproductive tissues for improving rice yield under water-deficit conditions. We show here that MID1 (MYB Important for Drought Response1), encoding a putative R-R-type MYB-like transcription factor, can improve rice yield under drought. MID1 was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses. Compared with wild type, MID1-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to drought at both vegetative and reproductive stages and produced more grains under water stress. MID1-overexpressing plants exhibited less severe anther defects such as deformed anther locules, abnormal tapetum, degenerated microspores and expanded middle layer, with improved pollen fertility and higher seed setting rate. MID1 was localized to the nucleus and could activate gene expression in yeast, and its homologs were identified in many other plants with high levels sequence similarity. In addition, candidate MID1-regulated genes were analysed using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR, including genes crucial for stress responses and anther development, with altered expressions in the florets of MID1-overexpressing plants and RNAi lines. Furthermore, MID1 could bind to the promoters of two drought-related genes (Hsp17.0 and CYP707A5) and one anther developmental gene (KAR) according to ChIP-qPCR data. Our findings suggest that MID1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement.

NA	OsARM1, an R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor, Is Involved in Regulation of the Response to Arsenic Stress in Rice.	2017	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Biocontrol, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, School of Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.	Bioaccumulation of arsenic (As) in rice (Oryza sativa) increases human exposure to this toxic, carcinogenic element. Recent studies identified several As transporters, but the regulation of these transporters remains unclear. Here, we show that the rice R2R3 MYB transcription factor OsARM1 (ARSENITE-RESPONSIVE MYB1) regulates As-associated transporters genes. Treatment with As(III) induced OsARM1 transcript accumulation and an OsARM1-GFP fusion localized to the nucleus. Histochemical analysis of OsARM1pro::GUS lines indicated that OsARM1 was expressed in the phloem of vascular bundles in basal and upper nodes. Knockout of OsARM1 (OsARM1-KO CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants) improved tolerance to As(III) and overexpression of OsARM1 (OsARM1-OE lines) increased sensitivity to As(III). Measurement of As in As(III)-treated plants showed that under low As(III) conditions (2 ¦ÌM), more As was transported from the roots to the shoots in OsARM1-KOs. By contrast, more As accumulated in the roots in OsARM1-OEs in response to high As(III) exposure (25 ¦ÌM). In particular, the As(III) levels in node I were significantly higher in OsARM1-KOs, but significantly lower in OsARM1-OEs, compared to wild-type plants, implying that OsARM1 is important for the regulation of root-to-shoot translocation of As. Moreover, OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi6, which encode key As transporters, were significantly downregulated in OsARM1-OEs and upregulated in OsARM1-KOs compared to wild type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR of OsARM1-OEs indicated that OsARM1 binds to the conserved MYB-binding sites in the promoters or genomic regions of OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi6 in rice. Our findings suggest that the OsARM1 transcription factor has essential functions in regulating As uptake and root-to-shoot translocation in rice.
