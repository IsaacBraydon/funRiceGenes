Lsi1|OsNIP2;1|OsLsi1	MID1|OsARM1	OsARM1, an R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor, Is Involved in Regulation of the Response to Arsenic Stress in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR of OsARM1-OEs indicated that OsARM1 binds to the conserved MYB-binding sites in the promoters or genomic regions of OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi6 in rice
Lsi2|OsLsi2	MID1|OsARM1	OsARM1, an R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor, Is Involved in Regulation of the Response to Arsenic Stress in Rice.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR of OsARM1-OEs indicated that OsARM1 binds to the conserved MYB-binding sites in the promoters or genomic regions of OsLsi1, OsLsi2, and OsLsi6 in rice
MID1|OsARM1	MYB1	OsARM1, an R2R3 MYB Transcription Factor, Is Involved in Regulation of the Response to Arsenic Stress in Rice.	 Here, we show that the rice R2R3 MYB transcription factor OsARM1 (ARSENITE-RESPONSIVE MYB1) regulates As-associated transporters genes
