MID1	leaf	MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.	 MID1 was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses
MID1	root	MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.	 MID1 was primarily expressed in root and leaf vascular tissues, with low level in the tapetum, and was induced by drought and other abiotic stresses
MID1	anther	MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.	 Our findings suggest that MID1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement
MID1	development	MID1 Plays an Important Role in Response to Drought Stress during Reproductive Development.	 Our findings suggest that MID1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes rice male development under drought by modulating the expressions of drought-related and anther developmental genes and provide valuable information for crop improvement
