MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	STD1 specifically interacts with MAP65-5 in rice and they cooperatively control microtubule bundles in phragmoplast expansion during cell division
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	 Here, we found that STD1 interacted directly with MAP65-5, a member of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs)
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	 Both STD1 and MAP65-5 could form homodimers and bundle microtubules individually
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	 Compared with MAP65-5, the microtubules bundled by STD1 were disassembled completely into single microtubules after adding ATP
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	 Conversely, the interaction of STD1 with MAP65-5 enhanced the microtubule bundling
MAP65-5	STD1	Rice kinesin-related protein STD1 and microtubule-associated protein MAP65-5 cooperatively control microtubule bundling.	 These results suggest STD1 and MAP65-5 might cooperatively regulate microtubule organization in the phragmoplast at telophase
