Chuong-2002-Identification of a.pdf	Identification of a rice RNA- and microtubule-binding protein as the multifunctional protein, a peroxisomal enzyme involved in the beta -oxidation of fatty acids	2002	J Biol Chem	Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 1N4, Canada.	The control of subcellular mRNA localization and translation is often mediated by protein factors that are directly or indirectly associated with the cytoskeleton. We report the identification and characterization of a rice seed protein that possesses both RNA and microtubule binding activities. In vitro UV cross-linking assays indicated that this protein binds to all mRNA sequences tested, although there was evidence for preferential binding to RNAs that contained A-C nucleotide sequence motifs. The protein was purified to homogeneity using a two-step procedure, and amino acid sequencing identified it as the multifunctional protein (MFP), a peroxisomal enzyme known to possess a number of activities involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. The recombinant version of this rice MFP binds to RNA in UV cross-linking and gel mobility shift experiments, co-sediments specifically with microtubules, and possesses at least two enzymatic activities involved in peroxisomal fatty acid beta-oxidation. Taken together these data suggest that MFP has an important role in mRNA physiology in the cytoplasm, perhaps in regulating the localization or translation of mRNAs through an interaction with microtubules, in addition to its peroxisomal function.
NA	ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM1 Functions in Salicylic Acid Biosynthesis to Maintain Proper Reactive Oxygen Species Levels for Root Meristem Activity in Rice.	2017	Plant Cell	College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University CITY: Hangzhou China [CN].	Root meristem activity determines root growth and root architecture and consequently affects water and nutrient uptake in plants. However, our knowledge about the regulation of root meristem activity in crop plants is very limited. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a short root mutant in rice (Oryza sativa) with reduced root meristem activity. This root growth defect is caused by a mutation in ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM1 (AIM1), which encodes a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in ¦Â-oxidation. The reduced root meristem activity of aim1 results from reduced salicylic acid (SA) levels and can be rescued by SA application. Furthermore, reduced SA levels are associated with reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aim1, likely due to increased expression of redox and ROS-scavenging-related genes, whose increased expression is (at least in part) caused by reduced expression of the SA-inducible transcriptional repressors WRKY62 and WRKY76. Like SA, ROS application substantially increased root length and root meristem activity in aim1. These results suggest that AIM1 is required for root growth in rice due to its critical role in SA biosynthesis: SA maintains root meristem activity through promoting ROS accumulation by inducing the activity of WRKY transcriptional repressors, which repress the expression of redox and ROS-scavenging genes.
