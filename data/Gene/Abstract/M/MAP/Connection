GTE4|OsGTE4	MAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
GTE4|OsGTE4	MAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
LAS	MAP	Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.	 By map based cloning we determined that the LAS allele gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS)
MAP	OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	 OsHsfA6a in-silico network was enriched in MAP kinases along with Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins
