GTE4|OsGTE4	MAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
GTE4|OsGTE4	MAP	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
LAS	MAP	Lethal albinic seedling, encoding a threonyl-tRNA synthetase, is involved in development of plastid protein synthesis system in rice.	 By map based cloning we determined that the LAS allele gene encodes threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS)
MAP	OsHSF6|OsHsfA2c|OsHsfA6a	Mapping of domains of heat stress transcription factor OsHsfA6a responsible for its transactivation activity.	 OsHsfA6a in-silico network was enriched in MAP kinases along with Hsp70 and Hsp90 proteins
MAP	OsMAPKKK63	OsMAPKKK63 is involved in salt stress response and seed dormancy control.	 Our data indicate that OsMAPKKK63 possesses in vitro kinase activity and that it interacts with rice MAP kinase kinase OsMKK1 and OsMKK6
ESP1	MAP	Eukaryotic peptide chain release factor 1 participates in translation termination of specific cysteine-poor prolamines in rice endosperm.	 To examine the genetic regulation of CysP prolamine synthesis and accumulation, we constructed a high-resolution genetic linkage map of ESP1
