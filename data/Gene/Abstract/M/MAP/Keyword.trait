OsMAP	meristem	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
OsMAP	shoot	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
OsMAP	auxin	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
OsMAP	auxin	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Nevertheless some genes, FAS1/FSM, GTE4 and MAP, require CRL1 to be induced by auxin suggesting that they are likely directly regulated by CRL1
OsMAP	transcription factor	Transcript profiling of crown rootless1 mutant stem base reveals new elements associated with crown root development in rice	Otherwise, three CRL1-dependent auxin-responsive genes: FSM (FLATENNED SHOOT MERISTEM)/FAS1 (FASCIATA1), GTE4 (GENERAL TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR GROUP E4) and MAP (MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) were identified
