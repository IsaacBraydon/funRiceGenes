miR156	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	The grain yield modulator miR156 regulates seed dormancy through the gibberellin pathway in rice.	 Mechanistically, mir156 mutations enhance seed dormancy by suppressing the gibberellin (GA) pathway through de-represssion of the miR156 target gene Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), which directly regulates multiple genes in the GA pathway
