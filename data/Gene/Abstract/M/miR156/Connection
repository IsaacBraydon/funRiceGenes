miR156	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	The grain yield modulator miR156 regulates seed dormancy through the gibberellin pathway in rice.	 Mechanistically, mir156 mutations enhance seed dormancy by suppressing the gibberellin (GA) pathway through de-represssion of the miR156 target gene Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), which directly regulates multiple genes in the GA pathway
miR156	OsLHP1	The Heterochronic Gene Oryza sativa LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 Modulates miR156b/c/i/e Levels 	 Loss of OsLHP1 function results in ectopic expression of MIR156B/C/I/E, phenocopy of miR156 overexpression, and reduced H3k27me3 levels at MIR156B/C/I/E
miR156	OsLHP1	The Heterochronic Gene Oryza sativa LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 Modulates miR156b/c/i/e Levels 	 Genetic and transcriptome analyses of wild-type, miR156b/c-overexpression, and Oslhp1-2 mutant plants suggest that OsLHP1 acts upstream of miR156 and SPL during the juvenile-to-adult transition
