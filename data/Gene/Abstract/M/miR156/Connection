miR156	OsSPL14|IPA1|WFP	The grain yield modulator miR156 regulates seed dormancy through the gibberellin pathway in rice.	 Mechanistically, mir156 mutations enhance seed dormancy by suppressing the gibberellin (GA) pathway through de-represssion of the miR156 target gene Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), which directly regulates multiple genes in the GA pathway
miR156	OsLHP1	The Heterochronic Gene Oryza sativa LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 Modulates miR156b/c/i/e Levels 	 Loss of OsLHP1 function results in ectopic expression of MIR156B/C/I/E, phenocopy of miR156 overexpression, and reduced H3k27me3 levels at MIR156B/C/I/E
miR156	OsLHP1	The Heterochronic Gene Oryza sativa LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 Modulates miR156b/c/i/e Levels 	 Genetic and transcriptome analyses of wild-type, miR156b/c-overexpression, and Oslhp1-2 mutant plants suggest that OsLHP1 acts upstream of miR156 and SPL during the juvenile-to-adult transition
miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 Interactions between miR156 and OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b were confirmed using transient expression assays through agroinfiltration
miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 In addition, the levels of OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b transcripts were lower in transgenic rice plants overexpressing miR156 than in wild-type plants
miR156	OsSPL2	Hydrogen peroxide regulates the Osa-miR156-OsSPL2/OsTIFY11b module in rice.	 The results suggested that H(2) O(2) accumulation in rice suppresses the expression of miR156, and induces the expression of its target genes, OsSPL2 and OsTIFY11b, whose proteins interact in the nucleus to regulate the expression of OsRBBI3-3, which is involved in plant defense
