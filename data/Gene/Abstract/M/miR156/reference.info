NA	The grain yield modulator miR156 regulates seed dormancy through the gibberellin pathway in rice.	2019	Nat Commun	Shanghai Center for Plant Stress Biology and Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 201602, Shanghai, China.	The widespread agricultural problem of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) could potentially be overcome by improving seed dormancy. Here, we report that miR156, an important grain yield regulator, also controls seed dormancy in rice. We found that mutations in one MIR156 subfamily enhance seed dormancy and suppress PHS with negligible effects on shoot architecture and grain size, whereas mutations in another MIR156 subfamily modify shoot architecture and increase grain size but have minimal effects on seed dormancy. Mechanistically, mir156 mutations enhance seed dormancy by suppressing the gibberellin (GA) pathway through de-represssion of the miR156 target gene Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), which directly regulates multiple genes in the GA pathway. These results provide an effective method to suppress PHS without compromising productivity, and will facilitate breeding elite crop varieties with ideal plant architectures.
NA	Expressing a Target Mimic of miR156fhl-3p Enhances Rice Blast Disease Resistance Without Yield Penalty by Improving SPL14 Expression	2020	Front. Genet.	Rice Research Institute and Key Lab for Major Crop Diseases, Sichuan Agricultural University at Wenjiang, Chengdu, China	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in the regulation of plant growth and defense responses. More and more, miRNA-3ps are reported to act in plant development and immunity. miR156 is a conserved miRNA, and most previous studies focus on its roles in plant growth, development, and yield determinacy. Here, we show that expressing a target mimic of miR156fhl-3p led to enhanced rice blast disease resistance without a yield penalty. miR156fhl-3p was differentially responsive to Magnaporthe oryzae in susceptible and resistant accessions. Transgenic lines expressing a target mimic of miR156fhl-3p (MIM156-3p) exhibited enhanced rice blast disease resistance and increased expression of defense-related genes. MIM156-3p also enhanced the mRNA abundance of SPL14 and WRKY45 by down-regulating miR156-5p and pre-miR156. Moreover, MIM156-3p lines displayed a decreased number of second rachis branches per panicle but enlarged grains, leading to unchanged yield per plant. Consistently, overexpressing miR156h (OX156) led to enhanced susceptibility to M. oryzae and decreased the expression of SPL14 and WRKY45. Our results indicate that miR156fhl-3p mounts a regulatory role on miR156-5p, which subsequently regulates the expression of SPL14 and WRKY45 to improve rice blast disease resistance.
