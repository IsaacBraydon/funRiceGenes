miR156	Expressing a Target Mimic of miR156fhl-3p Enhances Rice Blast Disease Resistance Without Yield Penalty by Improving SPL14 Expression |  Transgenic lines expressing a target mimic of miR156fhl-3p (MIM156-3p) exhibited enhanced rice blast disease resistance and increased expression of defense-related genes |  Our results indicate that miR156fhl-3p mounts a regulatory role on miR156-5p, which subsequently regulates the expression of SPL14 and WRKY45 to improve rice blast disease resistance
