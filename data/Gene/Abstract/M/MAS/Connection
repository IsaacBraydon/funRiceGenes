CYP99A2	MAS	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
CYP99A3	MAS	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
MAS	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
MAS	OsCPS4|OsCyc1	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
MAS	OsDTS2|OsKSL4|OsKS4	OsTGAP1, a bZIP transcription factor, coordinately regulates the inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice	The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment
BPH9	MAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	Here, we developed near isogenic lines of Bph9 (NIL-Bph9) by backcrossing elite cultivar 93-11 with Pokkali (harboring Bph9) using marker-assisted selection (MAS)
BPH9	MAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 Subsequently, we pyramided Bph6 and Bph9 in 93-11 genetic background through MAS
BPH9	MAS	Marker assisted pyramiding of Bph6 and Bph9 into elite restorer line 93-11 and development of functional marker for Bph9.	 The development of functional markers will promote MAS of Bph9
