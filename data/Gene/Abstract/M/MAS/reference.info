Production of major diterpenoid phytoalexins, momilactones and phytocassanes, is induced in rice upon recognition of pathogenic invasion as plant defense-related compounds. We recently showed that biosynthetic genes for momilactones are clustered on rice chromosome 4 and co-expressed after elicitation, mimicking pathogen attack. Because genes for most metabolic pathways in plants are not organized in gene clusters, examination of the mechanism(s) regulating the expression of such clustered genes is needed. Here, we report a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor-inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor, OsTGAP1, which is essential for momilactone biosynthesis and regulates the expression of the five genes in the cluster. The knock-out mutant for OsTGAP1 had almost no expression of the five clustered genes (OsCPS4, OsKSL4, CYP99A2, CYP99A3, and OsMAS) or production of momilactones upon elicitor treatment. Inductive expression of OsKSL7 for phytocassane biosynthesis was also largely affected in the ostgap1 mutant, although phytocassane accumulation still occurred. Conversely, OsTGAP1-overexpressing lines exhibited enhanced expression of the clustered genes and hyperaccumulation of momilactones in response to the elicitor. Furthermore, enhanced expression of OsKSL7 and hyperaccumulation of phytocassanes was also observed. We also found that OsTGAP1 overexpression can influence transcriptional up-regulation of OsDXS3 in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, eventually leading to inductive production of diterpenoid phytoalexins. These results indicate that OsTGAP1 functions as a key regulator of the coordinated transcription of genes involved in inductive diterpenoid phytoalexin production in rice and mainly exerts an essential role on expression of the clustered genes for momilactone biosynthesis.

Rice diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced in suspension-cultured rice cells treated with a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor and in rice leaves irradiated with UV light. The common substrate geranylgeranyl diphosphate is converted into diterpene hydrocarbon precursors via a two-step sequential cyclization and then into the bioactive phytoalexins via several oxidation steps. It has been suggested that microsomal cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450s) are involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons leading to the phytoalexins and that a dehydrogenase is involved in momilactone biosynthesis. However, none of the enzymes involved in the downstream oxidation of the diterpene hydrocarbons have been identified. In this study, we found that a putative dehydrogenase gene (AK103462) and two functionally unknown P-450 genes (CYP99A2 and CYP99A3) form a chitin oligosaccharide elicitor- and UV-inducible gene cluster, together with OsKS4 and OsCyc1, the diterpene cyclase genes involved in momilactone biosynthesis. Functional analysis by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli followed by enzyme assays demonstrated that the AK103462 protein catalyzes the conversion of 3beta-hydroxy-9betaH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6beta-olide into momilactone A. The double knockdown of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 specifically suppressed the elicitor-inducible production of momilactones, strongly suggesting that CYP99A2, CYP99A3, or both are involved in momilactone biosynthesis. These results provide strong evidence for the presence on chromosome 4 of a gene cluster involved in momilactone biosynthesis.
