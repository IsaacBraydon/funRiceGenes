MEG2	cell wall synthesis	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	Finally, thousand-grain weight of mutants were reduced by 20% (Figure 5C). MEG2 (Os10g0340600) encodes a beta galactosidase (BGAL) involved in cell wall synthesis.
