MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	 Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization
MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	 Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly
MIT	OsVIT2	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	 Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds
