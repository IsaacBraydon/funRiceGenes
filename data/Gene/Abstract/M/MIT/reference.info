1939-8433-6-31.pdf	The knockdown of OsVIT2 and MIT affects iron localization in rice seed	2013	Rice (N Y)	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan. annaoko@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp.	BACKGROUND: The mechanism of iron (Fe) uptake in plants has been extensively characterized, but little is known about how Fe transport to different subcellular compartments affects Fe localization in rice seed. Here, we discuss the characterization of a rice vacuolar Fe transporter 2 (OsVIT2) T-DNA insertion line (osvit2) and report that the knockdown of OsVIT2 and mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) expression affects seed Fe localization. FINDINGS: osvit2 plants accumulated less Fe in their shoots when grown under normal or excess Fe conditions, while the accumulation of Fe was comparable to that in wild-type (WT) plants under Fe-deficient conditions. The accumulation of zinc, copper, and manganese also changed significantly in the shoots of osvit2 plants. The growth of osvit2 plants was also slow compared to that of WT plants. The concentration of Fe increased in osvit2 polished seeds. Previously, we reported that the expression of OsVIT2 was higher in MIT knockdown (mit-2) plants, and in this study, the accumulation of Fe in mit-2 seeds decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that vacuolar Fe trafficking is important for plant Fe homeostasis and distribution, especially in plants grown in the presence of excess Fe. Moreover, changes in the expression of OsVIT2 and MIT affect the concentration and localization of metals in brown rice as well as in polished rice seeds.
ncomms1326.pdf	The rice mitochondrial iron transporter is essential for plant growth	2011	Nat Commun	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	In plants, iron (Fe) is essential for mitochondrial electron transport, heme, and Fe-Sulphur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis; however, plant mitochondrial Fe transporters have not been identified. Here we show, identify and characterize the rice mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT). Based on a transfer DNA library screen, we identified a rice line showing symptoms of Fe deficiency while accumulating high shoot levels of Fe. Homozygous knockout of MIT in this line resulted in a lethal phenotype. MIT localized to the mitochondria and complemented the growth of Deltamrs3Deltamrs4 yeast defective in mitochondrial Fe transport. The growth of MIT-knockdown (mit-2) plants was also significantly impaired despite abundant Fe accumulation. Further, the decrease in the activity of the mitochondrial and cytosolic Fe-S enzyme, aconitase, indicated that Fe-S cluster synthesis is affected in mit-2 plants. These results indicate that MIT is a mitochondrial Fe transporter essential for rice growth and development.
psb0610_1591.pdf	Identification and characterization of the major mitochondrial Fe transporter in rice	2011	Plant Signal Behav	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, Japan.	The uptake, translocation, and compartmentalization of Fe are essential for plant cell function and life cycle. Despite rapid progress in our understanding of Fe homeostasis in plants, Fe transport from the cytoplasm to mitochondria was, until recently, poorly understood. The screening of 3,993 mutant lines for symptoms of Fe deficiency resulted in the identification and characterization of a major mitochondrial Fe transporter (MIT) in rice. MIT was found to localize to mitochondria and to complement the growth of a yeast strain defective in mitochondrial Fe transport. The knock-out of MIT resulted in a lethal phenotype, and in knock-down plants, several agronomic characteristics were compromised, such as plant height, average number of tillers, days to flower, fertility, and yield. Changes in the expression of genes involved in Fe transport suggested a disturbance of cellular Fe transport. Furthermore, the mitochondrial Fe concentration and the activity of the mitochondrial Fe-S enzyme aconitase were significantly reduced compared with wild-type plants. The identification of MIT is a significant advance in the field of plant Fe nutrition and should facilitate the cloning of paralogs from other plant species.
NA	Knocking down mitochondrial iron transporter (MIT) reprograms primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants.	2015	J Exp Bot	Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie e Ambientali-Produzione, Territorio, Agroenergia, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, via Celoria 2-20133 Milano, Italy gianpiero.vigani@unimi.it khurram.bashir@riken.jp.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development, and its reduced bioavailability strongly impairs mitochondrial functionality. In this work, the metabolic adjustment in the rice (Oryza sativa) mitochondrial Fe transporter knockdown mutant (mit-2) was analysed. Biochemical characterization of purified mitochondria from rice roots showed alteration in the respiratory chain of mit-2 compared with wild-type (WT) plants. In particular, proteins belonging to the type II alternative NAD(P)H dehydrogenases accumulated strongly in mit-2 plants, indicating that alternative pathways were activated to keep the respiratory chain working. Additionally, large-scale changes in the transcriptome and metabolome were observed in mit-2 rice plants. In particular, a strong alteration (up-/down-regulation) in the expression of genes encoding enzymes of both primary and secondary metabolism was found in mutant plants. This was reflected by changes in the metabolic profiles in both roots and shoots of mit-2 plants. Significant alterations in the levels of amino acids belonging to the aspartic acid-related pathways (aspartic acid, lysine, and threonine in roots, and aspartic acid and ornithine in shoots) were found that are strictly connected to the Krebs cycle. Furthermore, some metabolites (e.g. pyruvic acid, fumaric acid, ornithine, and oligosaccharides of the raffinose family) accumulated only in the shoot of mit-2 plants, indicating possible hypoxic responses. These findings suggest that the induction of local Fe deficiency in the mitochondrial compartment of mit-2 plants differentially affects the transcript as well as the metabolic profiles in root and shoot tissues.
