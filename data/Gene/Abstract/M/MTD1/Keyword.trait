MTD1	pollen	Genome-wide analyses of late pollen-preferred genes conserved in various rice cultivars and functional identification of a gene involved in the key processes of late pollen development	Of these, MTD1 was predominantly expressed in late pollen stage, which supported our supposition that it has a primary role in this developmental process, as revealed in the loss-of-function mutants (Fig. <U+200B>(Fig.6d6d).
