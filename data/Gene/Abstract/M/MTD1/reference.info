Understanding late pollen development, including the maturation and pollination process, is a key component in maintaining crop yields. Transcriptome data obtained through microarray or RNA-seq technologies can provide useful insight into those developmental processes. Six series of microarray data from a public transcriptome database, the Gene Expression Omnibus of the National Center for Biotechnology Information, are related to anther and pollen development.We performed a systematic and functional study across the rice genome of genes that are preferentially expressed in the late stages of pollen development, including maturation and germination. By comparing the transcriptomes of sporophytes and male gametes over time, we identified 627 late pollen-preferred genes that are conserved among japonica and indica rice cultivars. Functional classification analysis with a MapMan tool kit revealed a significant association between cell wall organization/metabolism and mature pollen grains. Comparative analysis of rice and Arabidopsis demonstrated that genes involved in cell wall modifications and the metabolism of major carbohydrates are unique to rice. We used the GUS reporter system to monitor the expression of eight of those genes. In addition, we evaluated the significance of our candidate genes, using T-DNA insertional mutant population and the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Mutants from T-DNA insertion and CRISPR/Cas9 systems of a rice gene encoding glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase are defective in their male gamete transfer.Through the global analyses of the late pollen-preferred genes from rice, we found several biological features of these genes. First, biological process related to cell wall organization and modification is over-represented in these genes to support rapid tube growth. Second, comparative analysis of late pollen preferred genes between rice and Arabidopsis provide a significant insight on the evolutional disparateness in cell wall biogenesis and storage reserves of pollen. In addition, these candidates might be useful targets for future examinations of late pollen development, and will be a valuable resource for accelerating the understanding of molecular mechanisms for pollen maturation and germination processes in rice.
