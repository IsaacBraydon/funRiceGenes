Proteins induced in rice by auxin and zinc were determined by proteome analysis. Cultured suspension cells of rice were treated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and ZnSO4 and then proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; seven proteins were found to be induced by auxin and zinc. Of these seven, methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (MMSDH) was elevated by treatment with auxin alone. MMSDH was detected in cultured suspension cells, root and leaf sheath, but not in leaf blades. MMSDH responded to auxin and gibberellin, but did not respond to brassinolide and cytokinin. Furthermore, the amount of MMSDH in slr1, a constitutive gibberellin response mutant, was 2-fold that of wild type. MMSDH mRNA and protein were stimulated in root formation induced by auxin and/or zinc over a 4-week period. These results suggest that MMSDH may be necessary for root formation in rice induced by auxin and/or zinc.
