NA	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Fudan University;	The methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) plays critical roles in brassinosteroid (BR)-related processes, and is involved in controlling flowering time in rice. Although enzymes that catalyze this methylation reaction have been described, little is known about the recognition mechanisms to decipher H3K36 methylation information in rice. In this study, biochemical characterizations showed that MRG702 binds to tri-methylated H3K4 and H3K36 in vitro. Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SDG725, the MRG702 knock-down mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes. Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1. A binding analysis showed that MRG702 directly binds to the chromatin at target gene loci. This binding is dependent on the level of H3K36me2/me3, which is mediated by SDG725. Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725. Therefore, the role of MRG702 in the BR pathway and in controlling flowering time in rice is to function as a reader protein to decipher methylation information.
NA	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	2023	Int J Mol Sci	College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agriculture University, Nanjing 210014, China.	MORF-RELATED GENE702 (OsMRG702) regulates flowering time genes in rice, but how it controls transcription is not well known. Here, we found that OsMRGBP can directly interact with OsMRG702. Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that both OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP bind to the Ehd1 and RFT1 loci and the absence of either OsMRG702 or OsMRGBP leads to a decrease of H4K5 acetylation at these loci, indicating OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP cooperatively together to promote the H4K5 acetylation. In addition, whilst Ghd7 are upregulated in both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants, only OsMRG702 binds to the loci, together with the global increased and Ghd7 locus-specific increased H4K5ac levels in Osmrg702 mutants, suggesting an additional negative effect of OsMRG702 on H4K5 acetylation. In summary, OsMRG702 controls flowering gene regulation by altering H4 acetylation in rice; it works either together with OsMRGBP to enhance transcription by promoting H4 acetylation or with other unknown mechanisms to dampen transcription by preventing H4 acetylation.
