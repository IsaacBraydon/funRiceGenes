NA	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	2015	Plant Physiol	Fudan University;	The methylation of histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) plays critical roles in brassinosteroid (BR)-related processes, and is involved in controlling flowering time in rice. Although enzymes that catalyze this methylation reaction have been described, little is known about the recognition mechanisms to decipher H3K36 methylation information in rice. In this study, biochemical characterizations showed that MRG702 binds to tri-methylated H3K4 and H3K36 in vitro. Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SDG725, the MRG702 knock-down mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes. Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1. A binding analysis showed that MRG702 directly binds to the chromatin at target gene loci. This binding is dependent on the level of H3K36me2/me3, which is mediated by SDG725. Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725. Therefore, the role of MRG702 in the BR pathway and in controlling flowering time in rice is to function as a reader protein to decipher methylation information.
