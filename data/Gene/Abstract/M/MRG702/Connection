BU1|OsbHLH174	MRG702|OsMRG702	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1

MRG702|OsMRG702	SDG725	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Similar to the loss-of-function mutants of the rice H3K36 methyltransferase gene SDG725, the MRG702 knock-down mutants displayed typical BR-deficient mutant and late-flowering phenotypes
MRG702|OsMRG702	SDG725	MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.	Together, our results demonstrate that MRG702 acts as a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and deciphers the H3K36 methylation information set by SDG725
Ehd1	MRG702|OsMRG702	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1
Ehd1	MRG702|OsMRG702	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that both OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP bind to the Ehd1 and RFT1 loci and the absence of either OsMRG702 or OsMRGBP leads to a decrease of H4K5 acetylation at these loci, indicating OsMRG702 and OsMRGBP cooperatively together to promote the H4K5 acetylation
Ghd7	MRG702|OsMRG702	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 In addition, whilst Ghd7 are upregulated in both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants, only OsMRG702 binds to the loci, together with the global increased and Ghd7 locus-specific increased H4K5ac levels in Osmrg702 mutants, suggesting an additional negative effect of OsMRG702 on H4K5 acetylation
MRG702|OsMRG702	RFT1	Rice OsMRG702 and Its Partner OsMRGBP Control Flowering Time through H4 Acetylation.	 Both Osmrg702 and Osmrgbp mutants show the delayed flowering phenotype with the reduction in the transcription of multiple key flowering time genes, including Ehd1 and RFT1
