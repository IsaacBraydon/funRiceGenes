MOF	meiosis	MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double Strand Break Repair in Rice.	The recruitment of Completion of meiosis I (COM1) and Radiation sensitive51C (RAD51C) to DSBs is severely compromised in mutant meiocytes, indicating that MOF is crucial for DSB end-processing and repair
MOF	meiotic	MEIOTIC F-BOX Is Essential for Male Meiotic DNA Double Strand Break Repair in Rice.	Further analyses showed that MOF could physically interact with the rice SKP1-like Protein1 (OSK1), indicating that MOF functions as a component of the SCF E3 ligase to regulate meiotic progression in rice
