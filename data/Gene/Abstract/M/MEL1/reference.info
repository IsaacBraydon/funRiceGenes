Tapetum development and meiosis play crucial roles in anther development. Here we identified a rice gene, DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1), which controls the early stages of that development. This gene encodes for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein that is present only in cereals. Our T-DNA insertion mutations gave rise to abnormal tapetal formation. Cellular organelles, especially the ER, were underdeveloped, which led to hampered differentiation and degeneration of the tapetum. In addition, the development of pollen mother cells was arrested at the early stages of meiotic prophase I. RNA in-situ hybridization analyses showed that DTM1 transcripts were most abundant in tapetal cells at stages 6 and 7, and moderately in the pollen mother cells and meiocytes. Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis. However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant. Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants. These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1.
Plant Cell-2007-Nonomura-2583-94.pdf	A germ cell specific gene of the ARGONAUTE family is essential for the progression of premeiotic mitosis and meiosis during sporogenesis in rice	2007	Plant Cell	Experimental Farm, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan. knonomur@lab.nig.ac.jp	The rice (Oryza sativa) genome contains 18 copies of genes of the ARGONAUTE (AGO) family. Although AGO members play important roles in RNA-mediated silencing during plant development, a family member that is specifically involved in sexual reproduction has not been identified in plants. We identified the rice AGO gene MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1) from the analysis of seed-sterile mutants. In the mel1 mutant, chromosome condensation was arrested at early meiotic stages and irregularly sized, multinucleated, and vacuolated pollen mother cells (PMCs) frequently appeared in developing anthers. In addition, histone H3 lysine-9 dimethylation of pericentromeres was rarely reduced and modification of the nucleolar-organizing region was altered in mel1 mutant PMCs. The mutation also affected female germ cell development. These results indicate that the germ cell-specific rice MEL1 gene regulates the cell division of premeiotic germ cells, the proper modification of meiotic chromosomes, and the faithful progression of meiosis, probably via small RNA-mediated gene silencing, but not the initiation and establishment of germ cells themselves.
NA	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	2016	J Cell Sci	Experimental Farm, National Institute of Genetics, Yata 1111, Mishima, Shizuoka 411-8540, Japan.	Roles of epigenetic mechanisms including small RNA-mediated silencing in plant meiosis are largely remained unclear, despite of their importance in plant reproduction. This study unveiled that rice chromosomes were reprogrammed during premeiosis-to-meiosis transition in pollen mohter cells (PMCs). This large-scale meiotic chromosome reprogramming (LMR) continued throughout meiosis I, in which H3 lysine-9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) was increased, and H3K9 acetylation and H3 serine-10 phosphorylation were decreased broadly, as accompanying immunostaining pattern shift of RNA polymerase II. LMR occurred dependently on a rice Argonaute protein, MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1), which is specifically expressed in germ cells prior to meiosis, because LMR was depleted severely in mel1 mutant anthers. Pivotal meiotic events, such as pre-synaptic centromere association, DNA double-strand break initiation, and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, were also disrupted in the mutant. Interestingly, opposed to the LMR loss in most chromosomal regions, aberrant meiotic protein loading and hyper H3K9me2 accumulation emerged on the nucleolar organizing region in the mel1 PMCs. These results suggest that MEL1 plays important roles in epigenetic LMR to promote faithful homologous recombination and synapsis in rice meiosis.
NA	Spatial distribution of three ARGONAUTEs regulates the anther phasiRNA pathway.	2023	Nat Commun	Science and Technology Group, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), 1919-1 Tancha, Onna-son, Okinawa, 904-0495, Japan.	Argonaute protein (AGO) in association with small RNAs is the core machinery of RNA silencing, an essential mechanism for precise development and defense against pathogens in many organisms. Here, we identified two AGOs in rice anthers, AGO1b and AGO1d, that interact with phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) derived from numerous long non-coding RNAs. Moreover, 3D-immunoimaging and mutant analysis indicated that rice AGO1b and AGO1d cell type-specifically regulate anther development by acting as mobile carriers of these phasiRNAs from the somatic cell layers to the germ cells in anthers. Our study also highlights a new mode of reproductive RNA silencing via the specific nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of three AGOs, AGO1b, AGO1d, and MEL1, in rice pollen mother cells.
