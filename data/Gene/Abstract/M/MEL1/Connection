DTM1	MEL1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant
DTM1	MEL1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
MEL1	OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	However, expression of MSP1 and MEL1, which function in anther wall specification and germ cell division, respectively, was not altered in the dtm1 mutant
MEL1	OsMSP1|MSP1|OsTMS15	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
MEL1	PAIR1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
MEL1	Udt1	The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis	These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	LMR occurred dependently on a rice Argonaute protein, MEIOSIS ARRESTED AT LEPTOTENE1 (MEL1), which is specifically expressed in germ cells prior to meiosis, because LMR was depleted severely in mel1 mutant anthers
LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	Interestingly, opposed to the LMR loss in most chromosomal regions, aberrant meiotic protein loading and hyper H3K9me2 accumulation emerged on the nucleolar organizing region in the mel1 PMCs
LRD6-6|LMR	MEL1	Histone H3 modifications are widely reprogrammed during male meiosis I in rice dependently on MEL1 Argonaute protein.	These results suggest that MEL1 plays important roles in epigenetic LMR to promote faithful homologous recombination and synapsis in rice meiosis
