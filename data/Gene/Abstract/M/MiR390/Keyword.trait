MiR390	root	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.
MiR390	root	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	Here we show that miR390 induced by auxin promotes lateral root growth in rice
MiR390	root	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	 MiR390 was found to be dominantly expressed at lateral root primordia and roots tips while miR393 mainly expressed in the base part of roots at very low level
MiR390	root	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	We propose that miR390 induced by auxin triggers the lateral root growth under normal growth conditions, meanwhile miR393 just lurks as a potentially regulative role; Once plants suffer from stresses, miR393 will be induced to negatively regulate miR390-mediated growth of lateral roots in rice
MiR390	growth	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.
MiR390	growth	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	Here we show that miR390 induced by auxin promotes lateral root growth in rice

MiR390	auxin	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	 However, the risen expression level of miR390 induced by auxin didn't affect the expression of miR393 and its target OsTIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1)
