MiR390	OsTIR1	MiR393 and miR390 synergistically regulate lateral root growth in rice under different conditions.	 However, the risen expression level of miR390 induced by auxin didn't affect the expression of miR393 and its target OsTIR1 (Transport Inhibitor Response 1)
MiR390	OsDRB2|SRL10	DRB2 Modulates Leaf Rolling by Regulating Accumulation of MicroRNAs Related to Leaf Development in Rice.	 Moreover, OsDRB2 mutation also reduced accumulation of miR160, miR319, miR390, and miR396, which could cause the abnormal leaf development in rl89 by regulating expressions of their target genes related to leaf development
