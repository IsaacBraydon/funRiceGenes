MFAP1	growth	Blocking Osa-miR1871 enhances rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae and yield.	 The time-course experiment data reveal that the expression of miR1871 and MFAP1 in rice leaves, panicles and basal internode is dynamic during the whole growth period to manipulate the resistance and yield traits
MFAP1	resistance	Blocking Osa-miR1871 enhances rice resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae and yield.	 Conversely, the transgenic lines overexpressing MFAP1 (OXMFAP1) or overexpressing both MFAP1 and miR1871 (OXMFAP1/OX1871) resemble the resistance of MIM1871
