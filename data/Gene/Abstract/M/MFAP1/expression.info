MFAP1	 Intriguingly, miR1871 suppresses the expression of LOC_Os06g22850, which encodes a microfibrillar-associated protein (MFAP1) locating nearby the cell wall and positively regulating PTI responses |  The time-course experiment data reveal that the expression of miR1871 and MFAP1 in rice leaves, panicles and basal internode is dynamic during the whole growth period to manipulate the resistance and yield traits
