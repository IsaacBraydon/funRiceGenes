Rice tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits that determine grain yields. Our previous study has demonstrated that the MONOCULM1 (MOC1) gene is a key component that controls the formation of rice tiller buds. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of MOC1 involved in the regulation of rice tillering, we performed a yeast-two-hybrid screening to identify MOC1 interacting proteins (MIPs). Here we reported that MIP1 interacted with MOC1 both in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height. In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering.
