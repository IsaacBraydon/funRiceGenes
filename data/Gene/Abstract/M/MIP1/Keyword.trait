OsHUB1|MIP1	height	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height
OsHUB1|MIP1	tillering	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height| In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering
