OsHUB1|MIP1	height	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height
OsHUB1|MIP1	tillering	Identification and functional analysis of the MOC1 interacting protein 1	 The overexpression of MIP1 resulted in enhanced tillering and reduced plant height| In-depth characterization of the context of MIP1 and MOC1 would further our understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms of rice tillering

OsHUB1|MIP1	anther	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.
OsHUB1|MIP1	anther	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.	 Here, we report OsHUB1 (Oryza sativa HISTONE MONO-UBIQUITINATION1) and OsHUB2, the homologues of Arabidopsis HUB1 and HUB2 proteins which function as E3 ligases in H2Bub1, are involved in late anther development in rice
OsHUB1|MIP1	anther	Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice.
