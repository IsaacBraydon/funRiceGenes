NA	Conserved Imprinted Genes between Intra-Subspecies and Inter-Subspecies Are Involved in Energy Metabolism and Seed Development in Rice	2020	Int J Mol Sci	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon in which a subset of genes express dependent on the origin of their parents. In plants, it is unclear whether imprinted genes are conserved between subspecies in rice. Here we identified imprinted genes from embryo and endosperm 5-7 days after pollination from three pairs of reciprocal hybrids, including inter-subspecies, japonica intra-subspecies, and indica intra-subspecies reciprocal hybrids. A total of 914 imprinted genes, including 546 in inter-subspecies hybrids, 211 in japonica intra-subspecies hybrids, and 286 in indica intra-subspecies hybrids. In general, the number of maternally expressed genes (MEGs) is more than paternally expressed genes (PEGs). Moreover, imprinted genes tend to be in mini clusters. The number of shared genes by R9N (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Nipponbare) and R9Z (reciprocal crosses between 9311 and Zhenshan 97), R9N and RZN (reciprocal crosses between Zhonghua11 and Nipponbare), R9Z and RZN was 72, 46, and 16. These genes frequently involved in energy metabolism and seed development. Five imprinted genes (Os01g0151700, Os07g0103100, Os10g0340600, Os11g0679700, and Os12g0632800) are commonly detected in all three pairs of reciprocal hybrids and were validated by RT-PCR sequencing. Gene editing of two imprinted genes revealed that both genes conferred grain filling. Moreover, 15 and 27 imprinted genes with diverse functions in rice were shared with Arabidopsis and maize, respectively. This study provided valuable resources for identification of imprinting genes in rice or even in cereals.
NA	Ancestral function but divergent epigenetic regulation of HAIKU2 reveals routes of seed developmental evolution.	2022	Mol Plant	National Key Laboratory of Crop Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian 271018, China.	Evolution is driven by various mechanisms. A directional increase in the embryo to endosperm ratio is an evolutionary trend within the angiosperms. The endosperm constitutes a major portion of the seed volume in Poales and some dicots. However, in other dicots such as Arabidopsis and soybean, the endosperm proliferates early, followed by embryo growth to replace the endosperm. The Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor protein kinase AtHAIKU2 (AtIKU2) is a key regulator of early endosperm proliferation. In this study, we found that IKU2s from Brachypodium, rice, and soybean can complement the abnormal seed developmental phenotype of Atiku2, while AtIKU2 also rescues the defective endosperm proliferation in the Brachypodium BdIKU2 knockout mutant seeds. AtIKU2 and soybean GmIKU2 are actively expressed a few days after fertilization. Thereafter, expression of AtIKU2 is suppressed by the FIS-PRC2 complex-mediated H3K27me3. The soybean GmIKU2 locus is also enriched with H3K27me3 marks. The histone methyltransferase AtMEA is unique to Brassicaceae, but one GmSWN in soybean plays a similar role in seed development as AtMEA. By contrast, the BdIKU2 and rice OsIKU2 loci are continuously expressed and are devoid of H3K27me3 marks. Taken together, these results suggest that IKU2 genes retainÂ an ancestral function, but the duration of their expression that is controlled by PRC2-mediated epigenetic silencing contributes to silenced or persistent endosperm proliferation in different species. Our study reveals an epigenetic mechanism that drives the development of vastly different seed ontogenies.
