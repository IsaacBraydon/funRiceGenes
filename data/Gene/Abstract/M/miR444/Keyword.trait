miR444	root	Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.	 Transgenic rice plants expressing miR444 target mimic improved rice root growth
miR444	root	Nitrate-dependent regulation of miR444-OsMADS27 signalling cascade controls root development in rice.	 Although miR444 has the potential to target multiple genes, we identified OsMADS27 as the major miR444 target that regulates the expression of nitrate transporters, as well as several key genes including expansins, and those associated with auxin signalling, to promote root growth
