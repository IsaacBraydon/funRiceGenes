MHZ9	OsEIL1|MHZ6	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.	 The C-terminal domain of MHZ9 interacts with OsEIN2, a central regulator of rice ethylene signaling, and the N-terminal domain directly binds to the OsEBF1/2 mRNAs for translational inhibition, allowing accumulation of transcription factor OsEIL1 to activate the downstream signaling
