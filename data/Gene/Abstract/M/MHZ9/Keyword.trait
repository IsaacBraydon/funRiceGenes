MHZ9	transcription factor	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.	 The C-terminal domain of MHZ9 interacts with OsEIN2, a central regulator of rice ethylene signaling, and the N-terminal domain directly binds to the OsEBF1/2 mRNAs for translational inhibition, allowing accumulation of transcription factor OsEIL1 to activate the downstream signaling
MHZ9	ethylene	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.
MHZ9	ethylene	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.

MHZ9	ethylene	A translational regulator MHZ9 modulates ethylene signaling in rice.	 Ribo-seq analysis indicates that MHZ9 is required for the regulation of ~ 90% of genes translationally affected by ethylene
