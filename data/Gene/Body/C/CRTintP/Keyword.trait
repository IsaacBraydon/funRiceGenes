CRTintP	cold stress	A novel interaction between calreticulin and ubiquitin-like nuclear protein in rice	 Northern and immunoblot analysis showed increased expression of CRT and CRTintP in response to cold stress
CRTintP	leaf	A novel interaction between calreticulin and ubiquitin-like nuclear protein in rice	 Co-immunoprecipitation using anti-CRT antibodies confirmed the existence of the CRT-CRTintP complex in vivo in the stressed leaf tissue, suggesting their potential role in regulating stress response
