CHS|OsCHS1	sterile	Flavonoids are indispensable for complete male fertility in rice.	 In rice, the chalcone synthase mutant oschs1 produces flavonoid-depleted pollens and is male sterile
CHS|OsCHS1	fertility	Homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids most likely modulates starch metabolism for pollen tube penetration in rice.	 Our findings reveal a new mechanism that OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism through modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affects α-amylase activity to maintain PT penetration in rice, which contributes to a better understanding of the function of CHS1 in crop fertility and breeding
CHS|OsCHS1	starch	Homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids most likely modulates starch metabolism for pollen tube penetration in rice.	 Our findings reveal a new mechanism that OsCHS1 modulates starch hydrolysis and glycometabolism through modulating the metabolic homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids which affects α-amylase activity to maintain PT penetration in rice, which contributes to a better understanding of the function of CHS1 in crop fertility and breeding
CHS|OsCHS1	homeostasis	Homeostasis of flavonoids and triterpenoids most likely modulates starch metabolism for pollen tube penetration in rice.	 Further analysis showed that loss of OsCHS1 function disrupted the homeostasis of flavonoid and triterpenoid metabolism and led to the accumulation of triterpenoid, which inhibits significantly α-amylase activity, amyloplast hydrolysis and monosaccharide content in xt6, these ultimately impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, reduced ATP content and lowered the turgor pressure as well
