OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.
OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 There is still no genetic evidence so far about the requirement of OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 in rice BR biosynthesis
OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 The overall growth and development of oscpd1 and oscpd2 single knock-out mutants was indistinguishable from the wild-type, whereas, the oscpd1 oscpd2 double mutant displayed multiple and obvious BR-related defects
OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 Cytological analyses further indicated the defective cell elongation in oscpd1 oscpd2 double mutant
OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 led to a typical BR enhanced phenotype, with enlarged leaf angle and increased grain size
OsCPD1	OsCPD2	OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 are functional brassinosteroid biosynthesis genes in rice.	 Taken together, our results provide direct genetic evidence that OsCPD1 and OsCPD2 play essential and redundant roles in maintenance of plant architecture by modulating BR biosynthesis in rice
