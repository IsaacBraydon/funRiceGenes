CDSP32	oxidative	Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage	"One of the mechanisms plants have developed for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage involves a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, which has been proposed to be reduced by ferredoxin and plastid thioredoxins, Trx x and CDSP32, the FTR/Trx pathway"
