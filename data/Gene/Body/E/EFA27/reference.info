Frandsen-1996-Novel plant Ca(2+)-b.pdf	Novel Plant Ca[IMAGE]-binding Protein Expressed in Response to Abscisic Acid and Osmotic Stress	1996	Journal of Biological Chemistry	Institute of Molecular Biology, Copenhagen University, Denmark.	A cDNA corresponding to an mRNA which accumulates in germinating rice seeds in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid was isolated by differential hybridization. Northern blotting indicated that the mRNA also accumulates in vegetative tissues in response to treatment with abscisic acid and to osmotic stress. Sequencing identified a major open reading frame encoding a novel protein of 27.4 kDa. The identity of the open reading frame was confirmed by comparing the translation products of cellular, hybrid-selected, and in vitro transcribed RNAs and by immunoprecipitation. Western blotting of cellular extracts indicated that the protein is associated with microsomal or membrane fractions. Data base searches indicated that it contains a conserved Ca(2+)-binding, EF-hand motif and that related proteins are similarly expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana. A fusion protein purified from Escherichia coli containing the putative EF-hand region was shown to bind Ca2+ in blot binding assays. These data identify a novel gene family encoding proteins involved in the response of plants to abscisic acid and osmotic stress.
NA	OsClo5 functions as a transcriptional co-repressor by interacting with OsDi19-5 to negatively affect salt stress tolerance in rice seedlings	2020	Plant Journal	MOA Key Laboratory of Crop Ecophysiology & Farming System in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, College of Plant Science & Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	Caleosins constitute a small protein family with one calcium-binding EF-hand motif. They are involved in the regulation of development and response to abiotic stress in plants. Nevertheless, how they impact salt stress tolerance in rice is largely unknown. Thereby, biochemical and molecular genetic experiments were carried out, the results revealed that OsClo5 had was able to bind calcium and phospholipids in vitro and localized in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum in rice protoplasts. At the germination and early seedlings stages, overexpression transgenic lines and T-DNA mutant lines exhibited the reduced and increased tolerance to salt stress, respectively, compared with the wild type. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and in vitro pull-down assays demonstrated that the EF-hand motif of OsClo5 was essential for the interactions with itself and OsDi19-5. Yeast one-hybrid, electrophoretic migration shift and dual-luciferase reporter assays identified OsDi19-5 as a transcriptional repressor via the TACART cis-element in the promoters of two salt-stress-related target genes, OsUSP and OsMST. In addition, OsClo5 enhanced the inhibitory effect of OsDi19-5 in the tobacco transient system, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in rice seedlings under salt stress. The collective results deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the roles of caleosin in the salt stress response. These findings will also inform efforts to improve salt tolerance of rice.
