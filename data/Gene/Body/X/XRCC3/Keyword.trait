XRCC3	growth	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
XRCC3	sterility	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
XRCC3	vegetative	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
XRCC3	meiosis	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 Taken together, the results suggest that XRCC3 plays critical roles in both DSB repair and homologous chromosome recombination during rice meiosis
XRCC3	male sterility	XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.	 The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
