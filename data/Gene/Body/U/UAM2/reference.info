Konishi-2007-A plant mutase that.pdf	A plant mutase that interconverts UDP-arabinofuranose and UDP-arabinopyranose	2007	Glycobiology	Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Plant cell walls constitute the bulk of the earth renewable source of energy and are a component in the diet of humans and herbivores. l-Arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues are a quantifiably important constituent of these walls. Plants use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-l-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) to donate Araf residues in the biosynthesis of Araf-containing polysaccharides, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. However, little is known about the formation of UDP-Araf. We now describe the purification and partial characterization of a rice UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM) that catalyzes the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap). The reaction is reversible and at thermodynamic equilibrium the pyranose form is favored over the furanose form (90 : 10). Three related proteins that are encoded by rice gene loci Os03g40270, Os04g56520, and Os07g41360 were identified from partial amino acid sequences of UAM. These proteins have >80% sequence identity with polypeptides that are reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-sugars. The rice mutase and two functionally active recombinant mutases were shown to be reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-Glc. The cofactor, flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD), is required for the catalytic activity of UDP-galactose mutases of prokaryotes, fungi, and protozoa. The plant mutases, which do not require a cofactor, must therefore have a different catalytic mechanism. Putative UAM-encoding genes are present in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the gymnosperm Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and in numerous dicots and monocots, indicating that UAMs are widespread in green plants.
Konishi-2011-Down-regulation of U.pdf	Down-regulation of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase reduces the proportion of arabinofuranose present in rice cell walls	2011	Phytochemistry	Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan.	Arabinoxylans may account for up to 25% of the mass of grass cell walls. The interactions of these polysaccharides with themselves and with cellulose and lignin is believed to affect the walls physical properties and increase the walls resistance to biochemical conversion to fermentable sugars. Arabinoxylans have a backbone composed of 1,4-linked beta-D-xylosyl residues, some of which are substituted at O-2 or O-3 with single arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. The Araf residues are likely transferred from UDP-Araf to the xylan backbone by arabinofuranosyltransferases. UDP-Araf is itself formed from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) by UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM). In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to suppress UAM expression in rice plants and thereby reduce the amounts of UDP-Araf available for cell wall synthesis. Several of the transgenic plants had reduced proportions of Araf in their walls together with a decrease in the extent of substitution of the xylan backbone, and a reduction of between 25% and 80% in ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid contents of the cell walls. Those transgenic plants with >25% reduction in the amounts of Araf were dwarfed and infertile.
NA	X-ray diffraction analysis and in vitro characterization of the UAM2 protein from Oryza sativa.	2017	Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun	DTU Bioengineering, Technical University of Denmark, Elektrovej, Building 375, 2800 Lyngby, Denmark.	The role of seemingly non-enzymatic proteins in complexes interconverting UDP-arabinopyranose and UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-arabinosemutases; UAMs) in the plant cytosol remains unknown. To shed light on their function, crystallographic and functional studies of the seemingly non-enzymatic UAM2 protein from Oryza sativa (OsUAM2) were undertaken. Here, X-ray diffraction data are reported, as well as analysis of the oligomeric state in the crystal and in solution. OsUAM2 crystallizes readily but forms highly radiation-sensitive crystals with limited diffraction power, requiring careful low-dose vector data acquisition. Using size-exclusion chromatography, it is shown that the protein is monomeric in solution. Finally, limited proteolysis was employed to demonstrate DTT-enhanced proteolytic digestion, indicating the existence of at least one intramolecular disulfide bridge or, alternatively, a requirement for a structural metal ion.
