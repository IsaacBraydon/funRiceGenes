A cDNA fragment was cloned from rice immature seeds by the RT-PCR method. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA showed a high degree of identity with UDP-d-glucuronic acid decarboxylase (UXS) from other plants and was most similar to the soluble UXS from Arabidopsis. The recombinant protein, expressed in an Escherichia coli system, catalysed the conversion of UDP-d-glucuronic acid to UDP-d-xylose, confirming that the gene encoded UXS. The uxs gene was expressed in mature, harvested rice seeds as well as in immature seeds 14 d post-anthesis, suggesting that the uxs gene is necessary at the beginning of the germination period. This is the first report of the cloning of the uxs gene from monocots.
