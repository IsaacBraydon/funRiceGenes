Konishi-2007-A plant mutase that.pdf	A plant mutase that interconverts UDP-arabinofuranose and UDP-arabinopyranose	2007	Glycobiology	Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.	Plant cell walls constitute the bulk of the earth renewable source of energy and are a component in the diet of humans and herbivores. l-Arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues are a quantifiably important constituent of these walls. Plants use uridine diphosphate (UDP)-l-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) to donate Araf residues in the biosynthesis of Araf-containing polysaccharides, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. However, little is known about the formation of UDP-Araf. We now describe the purification and partial characterization of a rice UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM) that catalyzes the formation of UDP-Araf from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap). The reaction is reversible and at thermodynamic equilibrium the pyranose form is favored over the furanose form (90 : 10). Three related proteins that are encoded by rice gene loci Os03g40270, Os04g56520, and Os07g41360 were identified from partial amino acid sequences of UAM. These proteins have >80% sequence identity with polypeptides that are reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-sugars. The rice mutase and two functionally active recombinant mutases were shown to be reversibly glycosylated in the presence of UDP-Glc. The cofactor, flavin-adenine-dinucleotide (FAD), is required for the catalytic activity of UDP-galactose mutases of prokaryotes, fungi, and protozoa. The plant mutases, which do not require a cofactor, must therefore have a different catalytic mechanism. Putative UAM-encoding genes are present in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the gymnosperm Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and in numerous dicots and monocots, indicating that UAMs are widespread in green plants.
Konishi-2011-Down-regulation of U.pdf	Down-regulation of UDP-arabinopyranose mutase reduces the proportion of arabinofuranose present in rice cell walls	2011	Phytochemistry	Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan.	Arabinoxylans may account for up to 25% of the mass of grass cell walls. The interactions of these polysaccharides with themselves and with cellulose and lignin is believed to affect the walls physical properties and increase the walls resistance to biochemical conversion to fermentable sugars. Arabinoxylans have a backbone composed of 1,4-linked beta-D-xylosyl residues, some of which are substituted at O-2 or O-3 with single arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. The Araf residues are likely transferred from UDP-Araf to the xylan backbone by arabinofuranosyltransferases. UDP-Araf is itself formed from UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) by UDP-arabinopyranose mutase (UAM). In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to suppress UAM expression in rice plants and thereby reduce the amounts of UDP-Araf available for cell wall synthesis. Several of the transgenic plants had reduced proportions of Araf in their walls together with a decrease in the extent of substitution of the xylan backbone, and a reduction of between 25% and 80% in ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid contents of the cell walls. Those transgenic plants with >25% reduction in the amounts of Araf were dwarfed and infertile.
NA	UDP-Arabinopyranose Mutase 3 is Required for Pollen Wall Morphogenesis in Rice (Oryza sativa)	2014	Plant Cell Physiol	University of Tsukuba, Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8572, Japan.	L-Ara is a one of the main constituents of cell wall polysaccharides including pectic rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), glucuronoarabinoxylans (GAX), and other glycoproteins. It is found predominantly in the furanose form rather than in the thermodynamically more stable pyranose form. UDP-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf), rather than UDP-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap), is a sugar donor for the biosynthesis of arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues. UDP-arabinopyranose mutases (UAMs) have been shown to interconvert UDP-L-arabinofuranose (UDP-Araf) and UDP-L-arabinopyranose (UDP-Arap) and are involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides including Araf. The UAM gene family has three members in Oryza sativa. Co-expression networks in silico analysis showed that OsUAM3 expression was independent from OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 co-expression networks. OsUAM1 and OsUAM2 were expressed ubiquitously throughout plant development, but OsUAM3 was expressed primarily in reproductive tissue, particularly at the pollen cell wall formation developmental stage. OsUAM3 co-expression networks include pectin catabolic enzymes. To determine the function of OsUAMs in reproductive tissues, we analyzed RNAi-knockdown transformants (OsUAM3-KD) specific for OsUAM3. OsUAM3-KD plants grew normally and showed abnormal phenotypes in reproductive tissues, especially in terms of the pollen cell wall and exine. In addition, we examined modifications of cell wall polysaccharides at the cellular level using antibodies against polysaccharides including Araf. Immunolocalization of arabinan using the LM6 antibody showed low levels of arabinan in OsUAM3-KD pollen grains. Our results suggest that the function of OsUAM3 is important for synthesis of arabinan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan-I and is required for reproductive developmental processes, especially the formation of the cell wall in pollen.
NA	Gene Expression Dynamics in Rice Peduncles at the Heading Stage	2020	Front Genet	Grass Genetics and Informatics Group, School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India.	Improving grain yield in the staple food crop rice has been long sought goal of plant biotechnology. One of the traits with significant impact on rice breeding programs is peduncle elongation at the time of heading failing which leads to significant reduction in grain yield due to incomplete panicle exsertion. To decipher transcriptional dynamics and molecular players underlying peduncle elongation, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of elongating and non-elongating peduncles in two Indian cultivars, Swarna and Pokkali, at the time of heading. Along with genes associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis, we observed significant enrichment of genes associated with auxins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis/signaling in the elongating peduncles before heading in both the genotypes. Similarly, genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and mobilization, abiotic stress response along with cytokinin, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene biosynthesis/signaling were enriched in non-elongating peduncles post heading. Significant enrichment of genes belonging to key transcription factor families highlights their specialized roles in peduncle elongation and grain filling before and after heading, respectively. A comparison with anther/pollen development-related genes provided 76 candidates with overlapping roles in anther/pollen development and peduncle elongation. Some of these are important for carbohydrate remobilization to the developing grains. These can be engineered to combat with incomplete panicle exsertion in male sterile lines and manipulate carbohydrate dynamics in grasses. Overall, this study provides baseline information about potential target genes for engineering peduncle elongation with implications on plant height, biomass composition and grain yields in rice.
