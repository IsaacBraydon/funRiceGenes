OsARF18|RST1	OsASN1|OsAS1	Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.	 Molecular analyses showed that RST1 directly repressed the expression of the gene encoding asparagine synthetase 1 (OsAS1)
OsARF18|RST1	OsASN1|OsAS1	Transcriptional repressor RST1 controls salt tolerance and grain yield in rice by regulating gene expression of asparagine synthetase.	 Loss of RST1 function increased the expression of OsAS1 and improved nitrogen (N) utilization by promoting asparagine production and avoiding excess ammonium (NH(4)(+)) accumulation
