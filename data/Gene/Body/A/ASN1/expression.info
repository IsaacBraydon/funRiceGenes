OsASN1|OsAS1	 Cell-type and NH4 (+) inducible expression of OsAS1 as well as analyses of knockout mutants were carried out in this study to characterize AS1 |  Characteristics of the NH4 (+)-dependent increase and the root-surface cell-specific expression of OsAS1 gene are very similar to our previous results on cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 and NADH-glutamate synthase1 in rice roots
