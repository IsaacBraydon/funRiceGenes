OsASN1|OsAS1	root	Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.	OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of root surface (epidermis, exodermis, and sclerenchyma) in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner
OsASN1|OsAS1	tiller	OsASN1 Plays a Critical Role in Asparagine-Dependent Rice Development.	 These results suggest that OsASN1 is involved in the regulation of rice development and is specific for tiller outgrowth
