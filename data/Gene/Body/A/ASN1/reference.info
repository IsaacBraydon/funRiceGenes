These molecules play important roles in nitrogen assimilation, recycling, transport and storage in plants. Ammonium assimilation into asparagine is catalyzed by ammonia-dependent asparagine synthetase encoded by asnA (EC 6.3.1.1) or glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetase encoded by asnB (EC 6.3.5.4) in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These organisms display a distinct distribution of these two forms of asparagine synthetase. Gene and primary protein structure for asparagine synthetase-A and -B from prokaryotes and eukaryotes is examined. Using nucleotide sequences, we constructed a phylogenetic tree that distinguished two major classes (classes I and II) for ASN genes from a range of organisms. Only the glutamine-dependent asparagine synthetases-B have been identified, and are encoded by a small multigene family in plants. The isoenzyme encoded by each member of the gene family provides asparagine at specific phases of development. These include the nitrogen mobilization in germinating seeds, nitrogen recycling in vegetative organs in response to stress, and nitrogen remobilization during seed embryogenesis. The expression of genes for asparagine synthetase is regulated by light and metabolites. Genetic and molecular data using mutants and transgenic plants have provided insights into the light perception by the photoreceptors, carbon and nitrogen sensing and signal transduction mechanism in the asn regulation. Global analysis of carbon and nitrogen metabolites supports the impact of asn regulation in the synthesis and transport of asparagine in plants.
NA	Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Graduate School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, 1-1 Tsutsumidori-Amamiyamachi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, 981-8555, Japan.	Asparagine is synthesized from glutamine by the reaction of asparagine synthetase (AS) and is the major nitrogen form in both xylem and phloem sap in rice (Oryza sativa L.). There are two genes encoding AS, OsAS1 and OsAS2, in rice, but the functions of individual AS isoenzymes are largely unknown. Cell-type and NH4 (+) inducible expression of OsAS1 as well as analyses of knockout mutants were carried out in this study to characterize AS1. OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of root surface (epidermis, exodermis, and sclerenchyma) in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner. Conversely, OsAS2 mRNA was abundant in leaf blades and sheathes of rice. Although OsAS2 mRNA was detectable in the roots, its content decreased when NH4 (+) was supplied. Retrotransposon-mediated knockout mutants lacking AS1 showed slight stimulation of shoot length and slight reduction in root length at the seedling stage. On the other hand, the mutation caused an approximately 80-90% reduction in free asparagine content in both roots and xylem sap. These results suggest that AS1 is responsible for the synthesis of asparagine in rice roots following the supply of NH4 (+). Characteristics of the NH4 (+)-dependent increase and the root-surface cell-specific expression of OsAS1 gene are very similar to our previous results on cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 and NADH-glutamate synthase1 in rice roots. Thus, AS1 is apparently coupled with the primary assimilation of NH4 (+) in rice roots.
