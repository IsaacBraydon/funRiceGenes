OsAS2	nitrogen	Biological functions of asparagine synthetase in plants	 Genetic and molecular data using mutants and transgenic plants have provided insights into the light perception by the photoreceptors, carbon and nitrogen sensing and signal transduction mechanism in the asn regulation
OsAS2	nitrogen	Biological functions of asparagine synthetase in plants	 Global analysis of carbon and nitrogen metabolites supports the impact of asn regulation in the synthesis and transport of asparagine in plants
OsAS2	leaf	Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.	 Conversely, OsAS2 mRNA was abundant in leaf blades and sheathes of rice
