ASCAB9-A|CP26|Lhcb5	 Here, we report that the light-harvesting complex II protein, LHCB5, from rice is subject to light-induced phosphorylation during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae We demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LHCB5 promoter control the expression of LHCB5, which in turn correlates with the phosphorylation of LHCB5
