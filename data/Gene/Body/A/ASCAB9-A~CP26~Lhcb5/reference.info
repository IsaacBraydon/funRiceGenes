Higuchi-Takeuchi-2011-Functional analysis.pdf	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	2011	Plant Physiol	Plant Functional Genomics Research Group, RIKEN, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan.	Ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase (FNR) mediates electron transfer between ferredoxin (Fd) and NADP(+); therefore, it is a key enzyme that provides the reducing power used in the Calvin cycle. Other than FNR, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, glutamate synthase, and Fd-thioredoxin reductase also accept electrons from Fd, an electron carrier protein in the stroma. Therefore, the regulation of electron partitioning in the chloroplast is important for photosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. The regulatory mechanism of electron partitioning, however, remains to be elucidated. We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them. Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions. On the other hand, OsLFNR2 expression led to the impairment of photosynthetic linear electron transport as well as Fd-dependent cyclic electron flow around photosystem I. The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions. Thus, we propose that the stoichiometry of two LFNR isoforms plays an important role in electron partitioning between carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation.
Iwasaki-1997-Cloning of cDNA enco.pdf	Cloning of cDNA encoding the rice 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and analysis of light-induced expression of the gene	1997	Gene	National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Ibaraki, Japan.	Cloning of rice cDNA encoding the chlorophyll-binding 22 kDa protein of Photosystem II (PSII-S) and the light-induced expression of the gene are reported. One of the light-responsive cDNA clones, isolated by screening with a light-specific subtracted cDNA probe, was shown to encode PSII-S of rice. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that the PSII-S gene, psbS, is a single-copy gene in rice. A brief exposure to red light induced a severalfold increase in the steady state level of PSII-S transcripts in etiolated seedlings. The red light effect was reversed by far-red light, suggesting involvement of phytochrome in the PSII-S gene regulation. Prolonged exposure (3 h) to blue light, however, revealed a much stronger effect than red light on the accumulation of PSII-S transcripts in the etiolated seedlings. In dark-adapted green plants, prolonged exposure to blue light induced re-accumulation of transcripts encoding PSII-S, whereas red light had little effect.
Park-2012-Posttranscriptional.pdf	Posttranscriptional control of photosynthetic mRNA decay under stress conditions requires 3' and 5' untranslated regions and correlates with differential polysome association in rice	2012	Plant Physiol	School of Biotechnology and Environmental Engineering, Myongji University, Yongin 449-728, Korea.	Abiotic stress, including drought, salinity, and temperature extremes, regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Expression profiling of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from rice (Oryza sativa) leaves grown under stress conditions revealed that the transcript levels of photosynthetic genes are reduced more rapidly than others, a phenomenon referred to as stress-induced mRNA decay (SMD). By comparing RNA polymerase II engagement with the steady-state mRNA level, we show here that SMD is a posttranscriptional event. The SMD of photosynthetic genes was further verified by measuring the half-lives of the small subunit of Rubisco (RbcS1) and Chlorophyll a/b-Binding Protein1 (Cab1) mRNAs during stress conditions in the presence of the transcription inhibitor cordycepin. To discern any correlation between SMD and the process of translation, changes in total and polysome-associated mRNA levels after stress were measured. Total and polysome-associated mRNA levels of two photosynthetic (RbcS1 and Cab1) and two stress-inducible (Dehydration Stress-Inducible Protein1 and Salt-Induced Protein) genes were found to be markedly similar. This demonstrated the importance of polysome association for transcript stability under stress conditions. Microarray experiments performed on total and polysomal mRNAs indicate that approximately half of all mRNAs that undergo SMD remain polysome associated during stress treatments. To delineate the functional determinant(s) of mRNAs responsible for SMD, the RbcS1 and Cab1 transcripts were dissected into several components. The expressions of different combinations of the mRNA components were analyzed under stress conditions, revealing that both 3' and 5' untranslated regions are necessary for SMD. Our results, therefore, suggest that the posttranscriptional control of photosynthetic mRNA decay under stress conditions requires both 3' and 5' untranslated regions and correlates with differential polysome association.
NA	Phosphorylation-guarded light-harvesting complex II contributes to broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice.	2019	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Plant Pathology, College of Plant Protection, Nanjing Agricultural University, 210095 Nanjing, China.	Environmental conditions are key factors in the progression of plant disease epidemics. Light affects the outbreak of plant diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that the light-harvesting complex II protein, LHCB5, from rice is subject to light-induced phosphorylation during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae We demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LHCB5 promoter control the expression of LHCB5, which in turn correlates with the phosphorylation of LHCB5. LHCB5 phosphorylation enhances broad-spectrum resistance of rice to M. oryzae through the accumulation of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the chloroplast. We also show that LHCB5 phosphorylation-induced resistance is inheritable. Our results uncover an immunity mechanism mediated by phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II.
