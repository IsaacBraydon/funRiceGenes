ASCAB9-A|CP26|Lhcb5	resistance	Phosphorylation-guarded light-harvesting complex II contributes to broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice.	 LHCB5 phosphorylation enhances broad-spectrum resistance of rice to M
ASCAB9-A|CP26|Lhcb5	resistance	Phosphorylation-guarded light-harvesting complex II contributes to broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice.	 We also show that LHCB5 phosphorylation-induced resistance is inheritable
ASCAB9-A|CP26|Lhcb5	blast	Phosphorylation-guarded light-harvesting complex II contributes to broad-spectrum blast resistance in rice.	 Here, we report that the light-harvesting complex II protein, LHCB5, from rice is subject to light-induced phosphorylation during infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae We demonstrate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LHCB5 promoter control the expression of LHCB5, which in turn correlates with the phosphorylation of LHCB5
