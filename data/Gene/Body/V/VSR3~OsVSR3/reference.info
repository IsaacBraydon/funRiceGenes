Plant Physiol.-2011-Fukuda-632-44.pdf	The small GTPase Rab5a is essential for intracellular transport of proglutelin from the Golgi apparatus to the protein storage vacuole and endosomal membrane organization in developing rice endosperm	2011	Plant Physiol	Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University, Fukuoka 812-8581, Japan.	Rice (Oryza sativa) glutelins are synthesized on the endoplasmic reticulum as larger precursors, which are then transported via the Golgi to the protein storage vacuole (PSV), where they are processed into acidic and basic subunits. Three independent glutelin precursor mutant4 (glup4) rice lines, which accumulated elevated levels of proglutelin over the wild type, were identified as loss-of-function mutants of Rab5a, the small GTPase involved in vesicular membrane transport. In addition to the plasma membrane, Rab5a colocalizes with glutelins on the Golgi apparatus, Golgi-derived dense vesicles, and the PSV, suggesting that Rab5a participates in the transport of the proglutelin from the Golgi to the PSV. This spatial distribution pattern was dramatically altered in the glup4 mutants. Numerous smaller protein bodies containing glutelin and alpha-globulin were evident, and the proteins were secreted extracellularly. Moreover, all three independent glup4 allelic lines displayed the novel appearance of a large dilated, structurally complex paramural body containing proglutelins, alpha-globulins, membrane biomarkers for the Golgi apparatus, prevacuolar compartment, PSV, and the endoplasmic reticulum luminal chaperones BiP and protein disulfide isomerase as well as beta-glucan. These results indicate that the formation of the paramural bodies in glup4 endosperm was due to a significant disruption of endocytosis and membrane vesicular transport by Rab5a loss of function. Overall, Rab5a is required not only for the intracellular transport of proglutelins from the Golgi to the PSV in rice endosperm but also in the maintenance of the general structural organization of the endomembrane system in developing rice seeds.
