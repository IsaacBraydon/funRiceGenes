Murakami-2007-Comparative overview.pdf	Comparative overviews of clock-associated genes of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa	2007	Plant Cell Physiol	Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, School of Agriculture, Nagoya University, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan. t2706775@mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp	In higher plants, circadian rhythms are highly relevant to a wide range of biological processes. To such circadian rhythms, the clock (oscillator) is central, and recent intensive studies on the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana have begun to shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of the central clock. Such representative clock-associated genes of A. thaliana are the homologous CCA1 and LHY genes, and five PRR genes that belong to a small family of pseudo-response regulators including TOC1. Others are GI, ZTL, ELF3, ELF4, LUX/PCL1, etc. In this context, a simple question arose as to whether or not the molecular picture of the model Arabidopsis clock is conserved in other higher plants. Here we made an effort to answer the question with special reference to Oryza sativa, providing experimental evidence that this model monocot also has a set of highly conserved clock-associated genes, such as those designated as OsCCA1, OsPRR-series including OsTOC1/OsPRR1, OsZTLs, OsPCL1 as well as OsGI. These results will provide us with insight into the general roles of plant circadian clocks, such as those for the photoperiodic control of flowering time that has a strong impact on the reproduction and yield in many higher plants.
NA	Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.	2015	Plant Cell Environ	Department of Plant Science, Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Research Institute of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-921, Korea.	In the facultative long-day (LD) plant Arabidopsis thaliana, FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX1 (FKF1) is activated by blue light and promotes flowering through the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of CONSTANS under inductive LD conditions. By contrast, the facultative short day (SD) plant rice (Oryza sativa) flowers early under inductive SD and late under non-inductive LD conditions; the regulatory function of OsFKF1 remains elusive. Here we show that osfkf1 mutants flower late under SD, LD, and natural LD conditions. Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsFKF1 up-regulates expression of the floral activator Ehd2 and down-regulates expression of the floral repressor Ghd7; these regulators up- and down-regulate Ehd1 expression, respectively. Moreover, OsFKF1 can upregulate Ehd1 expression under blue light treatment, without affecting the expression of Ehd2 and Ghd7. In contrast to the LD-specific floral activator Arabidopsis FKF1, OsFKF1 likely acts as an autonomous floral activator because it promotes flowering independent of photoperiod, probably via its distinct roles in controlling expression of rice-specific genes including Ehd2, Ghd7, and Ehd1. Like Arabidopsis FKF1, which interacts with GI and CDF1, OsFKF1 also interacts with OsGI and OsCDF1 (also termed OsDOF12). Thus, we have identified similar and distinct roles of FKF1 in Arabidopsis and rice.
