Fd1	nitrogen	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	Fd1 is more abundant than Fd2 in high nitrate, similar to LFNR2.
Fd1	nitrogen	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	Fd2 mRNA is low under high-nitrate concentrations, although Fd1 is expressed at the same levels under any nitrogen conditions.
Fd1	seedling	Primary Leaf-type Ferredoxin1 Participates in Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Carbon Assimilation in Rice.	 Loss-of-function fd1 mutants showed chlorosis and seedling lethality at the three-leaf stage
Fd1	photosystem	Primary Leaf-type Ferredoxin1 Participates in Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Carbon Assimilation in Rice.	 Electron transfer assays involving NADP+ and cytochrome c indicated that Fd1 can donate electrons from photosystem I (PSI) to ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase
