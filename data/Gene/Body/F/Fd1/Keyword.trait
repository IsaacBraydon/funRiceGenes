Fd1	nitrogen	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	Fd1 is more abundant than Fd2 in high nitrate, similar to LFNR2.
Fd1	nitrogen	Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis	Fd2 mRNA is low under high-nitrate concentrations, although Fd1 is expressed at the same levels under any nitrogen conditions.
