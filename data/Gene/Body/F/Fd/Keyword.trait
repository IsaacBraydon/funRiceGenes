Fd	root	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5' region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3' noncoding region
Fd	root	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5' upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3' noncoding regions
Fd	root	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66~88%)
Fd	root	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
Fd	leaf	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66~88%)
Fd	leaf	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA
Fd	nitrate	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
