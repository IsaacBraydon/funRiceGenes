Fd	root	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	 The root Fd cDNA clone (pFDRR) was 603 bp long which contained 261-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> region encoding the C-terminal 72 amino acid residues and 342-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding region| The root Fd gene contained 1091-bp 5â€‘ù<U+3E32> upstream, 444-bp coding and 294-bp 3â€‘ù<U+3E32> noncoding regions| Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%)| Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
Fd	leaf	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	 Homology between the rice root and leaf Fds showed 60%, while the former protein shared much higher identity with other nonphotosynthetic Fds (66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>88%)| Southern blot analysis using pFDRR and the rice leaf Fd cDNA (pFDRL) as a DNA probe identified their corresponding genomic Fd DNA
Fd	nitrate	Cloning and expression of a ferredoxin gene in rice roots in response to nitrate and ammonium	 Expression of the root Fd gene was induced in response to nitrate and ammonium
