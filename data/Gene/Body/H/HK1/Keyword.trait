MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	root	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	 Here, through an analysis of a rice ethylene-response mutant mhz1, we show that MHZ1 positively modulates root ethylene responses
MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	ethylene	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	 Here, through an analysis of a rice ethylene-response mutant mhz1, we show that MHZ1 positively modulates root ethylene responses
MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	Kinase	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	 MHZ1 encodes the rice histidine kinase OsHK1
