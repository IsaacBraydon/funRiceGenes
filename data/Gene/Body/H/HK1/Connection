ERS2	MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	Ethylene receptor OsERS2, via its GAF domain, physically interacts with MHZ1/OsHK1 and inhibits its kinase activity.
MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	OsEIN2	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	Genetic analyses suggest that MHZ1/OsHK1 acts at the level of ethylene perception and works together with the OsEIN2-mediated pathway to regulate root growth.
MHZ1|OsHK1|HK1	OsRR21	Histidine kinase MHZ1/OsHK1 interacts with ethylene receptors to regulate root growth in rice.	MHZ1/OsHK1 is autophosphorylated at a conserved histidine residue and can transfer the phosphoryl signal to the response regulator OsRR21 via the phosphotransfer proteins OsAHP1/2.
