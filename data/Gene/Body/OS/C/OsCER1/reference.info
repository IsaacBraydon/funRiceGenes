Mol. Plant-2008-Zhang-599-610.pdf	Tapetum degeneration retardation is critical for aliphatic metabolism and gene regulation during rice pollen development	2008	Mol Plant	Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, China.	As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
NA	OsCER1 Plays a Pivotal Role in Very-Long-Chain Alkane Biosynthesis and Affects Plastid Development and Programmed Cell Death of Tapetum in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Subtropical Agro-Bioresources - Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics and Biotechnology of Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Institutions, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.	Cuticle waxes, which are primarily comprised of very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes, play an important role in plant reproductive development. ECERIFERUM1 (CER1) is recognized as the core element for VLC alkane biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). However, genes involved in the VLC alkane biosynthesis in rice remain unclear, and the alkane-form pathway in rice has still to be further explored. Here, we show that OsCER1, a homology of CER1, functions in VLC alkanes biosynthesis, which also could regulate anther development and plastids differentiation in rice. OsCER1 was highly expressed in the tapetum (stage 10) and bicellular pollen cells (stage 11). The decreased content of VLC alkanes (C25 and C27) in the OsCER1 knocked down plants as well as the increased content of C27 alkanes in the OsCER1 overexpression plants indicates that OsCER1 participates in VLC alkane biosynthesis. Downregulation of OsCER1 in rice led to sterility, and fewer amyloplasts within the mature pollen grains. In addition, the downregulation of OsCER1 in rice caused delayed tapetal programmed cell death and abnormal development of plastids in the tapetal cells. Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the OsCER1 knocked down plants. These results indicate that OsCER1 is critical for VLC alkanes biosynthesis, plastids differentiation, and pollen development. This work provides insights into the VLC alkanes biosynthesis in anther development in rice.
NA	Deficiency of very-long-chain alkanes biosynthesis causes humidity-sensitive male sterility via affecting pollen adhesion and hydration in rice.	2019	Plant Cell Environ	Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Physiology, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.	Pollen adhesion and hydration are the earliest events of the pollen-stigma interactions which allow compatible pollen to fertilize egg cells, but the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Rice pollen are wind dispersed, and its pollen coat contains less abundant lipids than that of insect-pollinated plants. Here, we characterized the role of OsGL1-4, a rice member of the Glossy family, in pollen adhesion and hydration. OsGL1-4 is preferentially expressed in pollen and tapetal cells, and is required for the synthesis of very-long-chain alkanes. osgl1-4 mutant generated apparently normal pollen, but displayed excessively fast dehydration at anthesis, and defective adhesion and hydration under normal condition, but the defective adhesion and hydration were rescued by high humidity. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis suggested the humidity-sensitive male sterility of osgl1-4 was probably due to a significant reduction in C25 and C27 alkanes. These results indicate that very-long-chain alkanes are components of rice pollen coat, and control male fertility via affecting pollen adhesion and hydration in response to environmental humidity. Moreover, we proposed that a critical point of water content in mature pollen is required for the initiation of pollen adhesion.
NA	OsCER1 regulates humidity-sensitive genic male sterility through very-long-chain (VLC) alkane metabolism of tryphine in rice	2021	Funct Plant Biol	State Key Laboratory for Conservation and Utilisation of Subtropical Agro-bioresources, College of Life Sciences, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou 510642, China.	Humidity-sensitive genic male sterility (HGMS) is a novel type of environment-sensitive male sterility (EGMS) which plants are male sterile at low humidity and male fertile at high humidity. Previous studies have revealed that OsCER1 contributes to very-long-chain (VLC) alkanes biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Here, applying the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, we obtained two independent OsCER1 knockout lines (OsCER1Cas). Both OsCER1Cas lines exhibited HGMS. Mutant pollen showed defects in adhesion and germination on stigmas at low humidity, whereas high humidity enhanced the pollen germination rate. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of mutant pollen revealed abnormal tryphine structure, potentially representing the basis of HGMS. Furthermore, co-pollination with mixed OsCER1Cas mutant and maize (Zea mays L.) pollen could rescue the fertility of the mutant, thereby establishing the key role of tryphine in germination on stigmas. OsCER1 knockout might affect VLC alkane metabolism and therefore alter the lipid composition of tryphine. It could lead to the defects in pollen grain adhesion, hydration and germination, resulting in HGMS. This work identified the mechanism of HGMS induced by VLC alkanes in rice and the generality of tryphine in different species of Gramineae.
NA	LEAF TIP RUMPLED 1 Regulates Leaf Morphology and Salt Tolerance in Rice.	2022	Int J Mol Sci	State Key Laboratory of Rice Biology, China National Rice Research Institute, Hangzhou 310006, China.	Leaf morphology is one of the important traits related to ideal plant architecture and is an important factor determining rice stress resistance, which directly affects yield. Wax layers form a barrier to protect plants from different environmental stresses. However, the regulatory effect of wax synthesis genes on leaf morphology and salt tolerance is not well-understood. In this study, we identified a rice mutant, leaf tip rumpled 1 (ltr1), in a mutant library of the classic japonica variety Nipponbare. Phenotypic investigation of NPB and ltr1 suggested that ltr1 showed rumpled leaf with uneven distribution of bulliform cells and sclerenchyma cells, and disordered vascular bundles. A decrease in seed-setting rate in ltr1 led to decreased per-plant grain yield. Moreover, ltr1 was sensitive to salt stress, and LTR1 was strongly induced by salt stress. Map-based cloning of LTR1 showed that there was a 2-bp deletion in the eighth exon of LOC_Os02g40784 in ltr1, resulting in a frameshift mutation and early termination of transcription. Subsequently, the candidate gene was confirmed using complementation, overexpression, and knockout analysis of LOC_Os02g40784. Functional analysis of LTR1 showed that it was a wax synthesis gene and constitutively expressed in entire tissues with higher relative expression level in leaves and panicles. Moreover, overexpression of LTR1 enhanced yield in rice and LTR1 positively regulates salt stress by affecting water and ion homeostasis. These results lay a theoretical foundation for exploring the molecular mechanism of leaf morphogenesis and stress response, providing a new potential strategy for stress-tolerance breeding.
