OsCER1	 The decreased content of VLC alkanes (C25 and C27) in the OsCER1 knocked down plants as well as the increased content of C27 alkanes in the OsCER1 overexpression plants indicates that OsCER1 participates in VLC alkane biosynthesis |  Furthermore, significantly altered levels of expression of genes involved in the pollen development were exhibited in the OsCER1 knocked down plants	 The decreased content of VLC alkanes (C25 and C27) in the OsCER1 knocked down plants as well as the increased content of C27 alkanes in the OsCER1 overexpression plants indicates that OsCER1 participates in VLC alkane biosynthesis
OsCER1|OsGL1-4|LTR1	 Functional analysis of LTR1 showed that it was a wax synthesis gene and constitutively expressed in entire tissues with higher relative expression level in leaves and panicles |  Moreover, overexpression of LTR1 enhanced yield in rice and LTR1 positively regulates salt stress by affecting water and ion homeostasis	 Moreover, overexpression of LTR1 enhanced yield in rice and LTR1 positively regulates salt stress by affecting water and ion homeostasis
