OsCMK|OsIspE	chloroplast	A single nucleotide mutation of IspE gene participating in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis causes green-revertible yellow leaf phenotype in rice.	 OsIspE is constitutively expressed in all tissues, and its encoded protein is targeted to the chloroplast
OsCMK|OsIspE	map-based cloning	A single nucleotide mutation of IspE gene participating in the MEP pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis causes green-revertible yellow leaf phenotype in rice.	 Map-based cloning revealed a missense mutation in OsIspE (LOC_Os01g58790) in gry340 mutant plants
