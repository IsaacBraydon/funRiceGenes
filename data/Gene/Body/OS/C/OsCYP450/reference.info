In order to understand flooding-caused low oxygen stress response at molecular level, microarray-linked isolation of the hypoxia inducible genes were conducted. Seventeen genes that were up-regulated by the factor of more than 3 fold, were confirmed as hypoxia inducible. Among them, a CCCH-type zinc finger protein gene, OsCCCH-Zn-1, was further characterized due to its novelty as a hypoxia-inducible zinc finger gene as well as its significant induction by hypoxia stress. OsCCCH-Zn-1 was also up-regulated by submergence, ABA and drought stresses. In the normal growth condition, OsCCCH-Zn-1 was expressed in the flag leaf sheath, highest internode and developing seeds. In rice, at least 12 CCCH-type zinc finger protein genes were retrieved by in silico analysis. Among these, we found that the zinc finger genes OsCCCH-Zn-1, -2, -6 were induced by hypoxia stress.
NA	Elevated levels of CYP94 family gene expression alleviate the jasmonate response and enhance salt tolerance in rice.	2015	Plant Cell Physiol	Bioscience and Biotechnology Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan.	A plant hormone jasmonate and its conjugates (JAs) have important roles in growth control, leaf senescence and defence responses against insects and microbial attacks. JA biosynthesis is induced by several stresses, including mechanical wounding, pathogen attacks, drought and salinity stresses. However, the roles of JAs under abiotic stress conditions are unclear. Here we report that increased expression of the cytochrome P450 family gene CYP94C2b enhanced viability of rice plants under saline conditions. This gene encodes an enzyme closely related to CYP94C1 that catalyses conversion of bioactive jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) into 12OH-JA-Ile and 12COOH-JA-Ile. Inactivation of JA was facilitated in a rice line with enhanced CYP94C2b expression, and responses to exogenous JA and wounding were alleviated. Moreover, salt stress-induced leaf senescence but not natural senescence was delayed in the transgenic rice. These results suggest that bioactive JAs have a negative effect on viability under salt stress conditions and demonstrate that manipulating JA metabolism confers enhanced salt tolerance in rice.
