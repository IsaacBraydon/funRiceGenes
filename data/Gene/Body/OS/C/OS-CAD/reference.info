Eleven clones exhibiting differential expression patterns were isolated and identified. We report here in detail the molecular cloning and characterization of one of the clones, OS-DFR2 which encodes a dihydroflavonol 4-reductase-like protein. RNA gel blot analysis revealed that OS-DFR2 expressed strongly in anthers but no expression was detected in roots, leaves, stems and pistils, indicating that OS-DFR2 was a tissue-specific gene. Furthermore, the expression of OS-DFR2 was developmentally regulated during early microsporogenesis. It accumulated at high levels in anthers undergoing meiosis and reached a maximal value during tetrad formation stage in the wild-type, AN-N. In AN S-1, the expression of OS-DFR2 resembled that of AN-N except its mRNA level is approximately one-fourth of that found in AN-N at the tetrad formation stage. In situ analysis indicated that OS-DFR2 transcript was specifically expressed in microsporocyte of AN-N; whereas OS-DFR2 was present both in microsporocyte and tapetal cells in AN S-1. The significance and possible role played by OS-DFR2 during male gametophyte development in rice is discussed.
