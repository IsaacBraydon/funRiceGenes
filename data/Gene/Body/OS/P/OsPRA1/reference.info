Its existence was also proved in plants by sequence analysis, anticipating its important role as a Rab effector, but defined roles of the plant PRA1 homologs remain to be obscure. Here, to get an insight for their role, we performed yeast two-hybrid screen using the OsRab7 as bait and first isolated the OsPRA1, a putative prenylated Rab acceptor, interacting with this protein. Detailed interaction analysis showed that OsPRA1 interacted not only with GDP-bound OsRab7, but also with several other Rab GTPases involved in vacuolar trafficking, in a prenylation-dependent manner. In addition, GFP-fusion analysis demonstrated that OsPRA1 localized to the prevacuolar compartment, and RNA gel blot analysis revealed its significant expression in rice green-aerial tissues such as shoots and mature stems. These results suggest that OsPRA1 may function as a Rab effector for vacuolar trafficking in the plant system.
