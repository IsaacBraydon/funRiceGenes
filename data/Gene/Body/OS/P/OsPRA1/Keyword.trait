OsPRA1	stem	The role of OsPRA1 in vacuolar trafficking by OsRab GTPases in plant system	In addition, GFP-fusion analysis demonstrated that OsPRA1 localized to the prevacuolar compartment, and RNA gel blot analysis revealed its significant expression in rice green-aerial tissues such as shoots and mature stems
OsPRA1	stem	The role of OsPRA1 in vacuolar trafficking by OsRab GTPases in plant system	These results suggest that OsPRA1 may function as a Rab effector for vacuolar trafficking in the plant system
