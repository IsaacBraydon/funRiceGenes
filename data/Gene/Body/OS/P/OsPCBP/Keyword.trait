OsPCBP	pollen	A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development	A pollen-expressed gene from rice, OsPCBP, that was previously cloned and identified encodes a novel calmodulin-binding protein
OsPCBP	pollen	A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development	Our experimental results provide convincing evidence that OsPCBP protein plays an important role during the late stage of pollen development
OsPCBP	microspore	A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development	Cytological observations at different stages revealed that microspores from the OsPCBP double-stranded RNA interference plants developed normally until the binucleate stage, but about half were later aborted
OsPCBP	anther	A Calmodulin-Binding Protein from Rice is Essential to Pollen Development	Overexpression of OsPCBP in transgenic rice plants did not lead to phenotypic changes but did delay anther formation by about 1 week
