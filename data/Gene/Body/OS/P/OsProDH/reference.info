Firstly, in roots, AS caused the reduction of NO 3 âˆ<U+393C><U+3E32> content, which caused two harmful consequences, the large downregulation of OsNR1 expression and the subsequent reduction of NH 4 + production in roots. On the other hand, under AS (pH, 9.11), almost all the NH 4 + was changed to NH3, which caused a severe deficiency of NH 4 + surrounding the roots. Both events might cause a severe deficiency of NH 4 + in roots. Under AS, the increased expression of several OsAMT family members in roots might be an adaptative response to the reduction of NH 4 + content in roots or the NH 4 + deficiency in rhizosphere. Also, the down-regulation of OsNADH-GOGAT and OsGS1;2 in roots might be due to NH 4 + deficiency in roots. Secondly, in shoots, AS caused a larger acuumulatiuon of Na+, which possibly affected photorespiration and led to a continuous decrease of NH 4 + production in shoots, and inhibited the expression of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in chloroplasts.
