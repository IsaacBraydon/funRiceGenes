Firstly, in roots, AS caused the reduction of NO 3 âˆ<U+393C><U+3E32> content, which caused two harmful consequences, the large downregulation of OsNR1 expression and the subsequent reduction of NH 4 + production in roots. On the other hand, under AS (pH, 9.11), almost all the NH 4 + was changed to NH3, which caused a severe deficiency of NH 4 + surrounding the roots. Both events might cause a severe deficiency of NH 4 + in roots. Under AS, the increased expression of several OsAMT family members in roots might be an adaptative response to the reduction of NH 4 + content in roots or the NH 4 + deficiency in rhizosphere. Also, the down-regulation of OsNADH-GOGAT and OsGS1;2 in roots might be due to NH 4 + deficiency in roots. Secondly, in shoots, AS caused a larger acuumulatiuon of Na+, which possibly affected photorespiration and led to a continuous decrease of NH 4 + production in shoots, and inhibited the expression of OsFd-GOGAT and OsGS2 in chloroplasts.
NA	OsProDH Negatively Regulates Thermotolerance in Rice by Modulating Proline Metabolism and Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging	2020	Rice	College of Life Sciences, Luoyang Normal University, Luoyang, 471934, China.	Background: Global warming threatens rice growth and reduces yields. Proline plays important roles in plant abiotic stress tolerance. Previous research demonstrated that engineering proline metabolism-related genes can enhance tolerance to freezing and salinity in Arabidopsis. OsProDH encodes a putative proline dehydrogenase and is a single copy gene in rice. However, whether OsProDH plays roles in abiotic stress in rice remains unknown.  Findings: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsProDH transcript contents were relatively higher in leaf blade and root tissues and the high temperature treatment repressed expression of OsProDH. The predicted OsProDH protein localized in mitochondria. Using the Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cultivar KY131, we generated OsProDH overexpression (OE) lines and knockout mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 (CRI) system. Overexpression of OsProDH decreased proline content, while mutation of OsProDH increased proline content compared with that of KY131. The CRI and OE lines were respectively more resistant and sensitive to heat stress than KY131. Heat stress induced proline accumulation and mutation of OsProDH led to proline overproduction which reduced H2O2 accumulation in the seedlings.  Conclusions: OsProDH negatively regulates thermotolerance in rice. Our study provides a strategy to improve heat tolerance in rice via manipulating proline metabolism.
