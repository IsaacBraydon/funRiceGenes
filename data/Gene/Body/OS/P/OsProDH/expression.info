OsProDH	  Findings: Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsProDH transcript contents were relatively higher in leaf blade and root tissues and the high temperature treatment repressed expression of OsProDH |  japonica cultivar KY131, we generated OsProDH overexpression (OE) lines and knockout mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 (CRI) system |  Overexpression of OsProDH decreased proline content, while mutation of OsProDH increased proline content compared with that of KY131	 japonica cultivar KY131, we generated OsProDH overexpression (OE) lines and knockout mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 (CRI) system |  Overexpression of OsProDH decreased proline content, while mutation of OsProDH increased proline content compared with that of KY131
