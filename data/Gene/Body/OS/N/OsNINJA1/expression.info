OsNINJA1	Overexpression of OsNINJA1 negatively affects a part of OsMYC2-mediated abiotic and biotic responses in rice. |  The expression of OsNINJA1 was upregulated at an early phase after JA treatment, and OsNINJA1 interacted with several OsJAZ proteins in a C domain-dependent manner |  Finally, the expression of OsMYC2-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and senescence-associated genes (SAGs) tended to be downregulated in the OsNINJA1-overexpressing rice plants	Overexpression of OsNINJA1 negatively affects a part of OsMYC2-mediated abiotic and biotic responses in rice.
