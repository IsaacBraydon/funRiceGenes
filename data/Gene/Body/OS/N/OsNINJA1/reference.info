Plant Cell Physiol-2012-Yamada-2060-72.pdf	Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice	2012	Plant Cell Physiol	Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795 Japan.	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) has a crucial role in both host immunity and development in plants. Here, we report the importance of JA signaling in the defense system of rice. Exogenous application of JA conferred resistance to bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) in rice. Expression of OsJAZ8, a rice jasmonate ZIM-domain protein, was highly up-regulated by JA. OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner. OsJAZ8 also formed heterodimers with other OsJAZ proteins but did not form homodimer. JA treatment caused OsJAZ8 degradation and this degradation was dependent on the 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, the JA-dependent OsJAZ8 degradation was mediated by the Jas domain. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsJAZ8DeltaC, which lacks the Jas domain, exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype. A large-scale analysis using a rice DNA microarray revealed that overexpression of OsJAZ8DeltaC altered the expression of JA-responsive genes, including defense-related genes, in rice. Furthermore, OsJAZ8DeltaC negatively regulated the JA-induced resistance to Xoo in rice. On the basis of these data, we conclude that JA plays an important role in resistance to Xoo, and OsJAZ8 acts as a repressor of JA signaling in rice.
NA	Overexpression of OsNINJA1 negatively affects a part of OsMYC2-mediated abiotic and biotic responses in rice.	2018	J Plant Physiol	Plant Genome and Resource Research Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Kagawa University, Miki, Kagawa, 761-0795, Japan.	The plant hormone jasmonic acid (JA) plays an important role in defense response and plant development. Jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors of plant responses to JA. In this study, we found that OsNINJA1, which is a JAZ-interacting adaptor protein, plays an important role in JA signaling that is positively regulated by the transcription factor OsMYC2 in rice. The expression of OsNINJA1 was upregulated at an early phase after JA treatment, and OsNINJA1 interacted with several OsJAZ proteins in a C domain-dependent manner. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsNINJA1 exhibited a JA-insensitive phenotype and were more susceptible to rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which is one of the most serious diseases affecting rice. Furthermore, OsNINJA1 negatively affected JA-regulated leaf senescence under dark-induced senescence conditions. Finally, the expression of OsMYC2-responsive pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and senescence-associated genes (SAGs) tended to be downregulated in the OsNINJA1-overexpressing rice plants. These results indicate that OsNINJA1 acts as a negative regulator of OsMYC2-mediated JA signaling in rice.
