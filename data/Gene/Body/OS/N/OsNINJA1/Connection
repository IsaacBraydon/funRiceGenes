OsMYC2	OsNINJA1	Overexpression of OsNINJA1 negatively affects a part of OsMYC2-mediated abiotic and biotic responses in rice.	 In this study, we found that OsNINJA1, which is a JAZ-interacting adaptor protein, plays an important role in JA signaling that is positively regulated by the transcription factor OsMYC2 in rice
