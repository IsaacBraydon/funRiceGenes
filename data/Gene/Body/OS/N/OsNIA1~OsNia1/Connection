OsDHODH1	OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	Nitrosative stress-mediated inhibition of OsDHODH1 gene expression suggests roots growth reduction in rice (Oryza sativa L.).	This study monitored the transcriptional response of OsDHODH1 under nitrosative stress conditions relative to the transcripts accumulations for the core mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase1 (CcOX1) subunit, nuclear CcOX subunits 5b and 5c, two rice nitrate reductases (OsNIA1 and OsNIA2), and nitric oxide excess 1 (OsNOE1) genes
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.	 Indica OsNR2 also promotes NO3- uptake via feed-forward interaction with OsNRT1
NRT1|OsNRT1|OsNRT1.1	OsNIA1|OsNia1|OsNR2	The indica nitrate reductase gene OsNR2 allele enhances rice yield potential and nitrogen use efficiency.	 These properties enable indica OsNR2 to confer increased effective tiller number, grain yield and NUE on japonica rice, effects enhanced by interaction with an additionally introgressed indica OsNRT1
