OsAKT2	seedlings	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	 Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions
OsAKT2	growth	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	 Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions
OsAKT2	shoot	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	 Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
OsAKT2	potassium	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.
OsAKT2	phloem	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	 Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
OsAKT2	plasma membrane	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	 Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane
OsAKT2	potassium	Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2	Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2
OsAKT2	plasma membrane	Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2	 Here, using a PA biosensor (PAleon), we found that the exogenous PA treatment significantly increased the PA level at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes which were used to express OsAKT2 for electrophysiological assays
