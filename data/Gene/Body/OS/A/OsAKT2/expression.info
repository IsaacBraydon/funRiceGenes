OsAKT2	 Overexpression of OsAKT2 complemented the K+ deficiency in the phloem sap and leaves of the mutant plants but did not significantly contribute to the transport of sugars |  However, the expression of OsAKT2-K191R overcame both the shortage of phloem K+ and sucrose of the akt2 mutant, which was comparable to the effects of the overexpression of AtAKT2, while the expression of the inward mutation AtAKT2-R195K resembled the effects of OsAKT2 |  Additionally, overexpression of OsAKT2 ameliorated the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis	 Overexpression of OsAKT2 complemented the K+ deficiency in the phloem sap and leaves of the mutant plants but did not significantly contribute to the transport of sugars |  However, the expression of OsAKT2-K191R overcame both the shortage of phloem K+ and sucrose of the akt2 mutant, which was comparable to the effects of the overexpression of AtAKT2, while the expression of the inward mutation AtAKT2-R195K resembled the effects of OsAKT2 |  Additionally, overexpression of OsAKT2 ameliorated the salt tolerance of Arabidopsis
