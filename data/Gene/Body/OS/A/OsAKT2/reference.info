Obata-2007-Rice shaker potassiu.pdf	Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells	2007	Plant Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	We screened a rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare') full-length cDNA expression library through functional complementation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to find novel cation transporters involved in salt tolerance. We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (OsKAT1), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux. It also suppressed a K(+)-transport-defective phenotype of yeast strain CY162 (Deltatrk1Deltatrk2), suggesting the enhancement of K(+) uptake by OsKAT1. By the expression of OsKAT1, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase. At the linear phase, however, OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells accumulated less Na(+) than nonexpressing cells, but almost the same K(+). The cellular Na(+) to K(+) ratio of OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells remained lower than nonexpressing cells under saline conditions. Rice cells overexpressing OsKAT1 also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K(+) content. These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1. The expression of OsKAT1 was restricted to internodes and rachides of wild-type rice, whereas other Shaker family genes were expressed in various organs. These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+).
NA	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The plant Shaker K+ channel AtAKT2 has been identified as a weakly rectifying channel that can stabilize membrane potentials to promote photoassimilate phloem loading and translocation. Thus, studies on functional characterization and regulatory mechanisms of AtAKT2-like channels in crops are highly important for improving crop production. Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane. Using an electrophysiological assay, we found that OsAKT2 operated as a weakly rectifying K+ channel, preventing H+ /sucrose-symport-induced membrane depolarization. Three critical amino acid residues (K193, N206 and S326) are essential to the phosphorylation-mediated gating change of OsAKT2, consistent with the roles of the corresponding sites in AtAKT2. Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions. Interestingly, the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) inhibits OsAKT2-mediated currents (both instantaneous and time-dependent components). Lipid dot-blot assay and liposome-protein binding analysis revealed that PA directly bound with two adjacent arginine residues in the ANK domain of OsAKT2, which is essential to PA-mediated inhibition of OsAKT2. Electrophysiological and phenotypic analyses also showed the PA-mediated inhibition of AtAKT2 and the negative correlation between intrinsic PA level and Arabidopsis growth, suggesting that PA may inhibit AKT2 function to affect plant growth and development. Our results functionally characterize the Shaker K+ channel OsAKT2 and reveal a direct link between phospholipid signaling and plant K+ channel modulation.
