Obata-2007-Rice shaker potassiu.pdf	Rice shaker potassium channel OsKAT1 confers tolerance to salinity stress on yeast and rice cells	2007	Plant Physiol	Division of Plant Sciences, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Tsukuba 305-8602, Japan.	We screened a rice (Oryza sativa L. 'Nipponbare') full-length cDNA expression library through functional complementation in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to find novel cation transporters involved in salt tolerance. We found that expression of a cDNA clone, encoding the rice homolog of Shaker family K(+) channel KAT1 (OsKAT1), suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of yeast strain G19 (Deltaena1-4), which lacks a major component of Na(+) efflux. It also suppressed a K(+)-transport-defective phenotype of yeast strain CY162 (Deltatrk1Deltatrk2), suggesting the enhancement of K(+) uptake by OsKAT1. By the expression of OsKAT1, the K(+) contents of salt-stressed G19 cells increased during the exponential growth phase. At the linear phase, however, OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells accumulated less Na(+) than nonexpressing cells, but almost the same K(+). The cellular Na(+) to K(+) ratio of OsKAT1-expressing G19 cells remained lower than nonexpressing cells under saline conditions. Rice cells overexpressing OsKAT1 also showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased cellular K(+) content. These functions of OsKAT1 are likely to be common among Shaker K(+) channels because OsAKT1 and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KAT1 were able to complement the salt-sensitive phenotype of G19 as well as OsKAT1. The expression of OsKAT1 was restricted to internodes and rachides of wild-type rice, whereas other Shaker family genes were expressed in various organs. These results suggest that OsKAT1 is involved in salt tolerance of rice in cooperation with other K(+) channels by participating in maintenance of cytosolic cation homeostasis during salt stress and thus protects cells from Na(+).
NA	Phosphatidic acid directly binds with rice potassium channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its activity.	2020	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.	The plant Shaker K+ channel AtAKT2 has been identified as a weakly rectifying channel that can stabilize membrane potentials to promote photoassimilate phloem loading and translocation. Thus, studies on functional characterization and regulatory mechanisms of AtAKT2-like channels in crops are highly important for improving crop production. Here, we identified the rice OsAKT2 as the ortholog of Arabidopsis AtAKT2, which is primarily expressed in the shoot phloem and localized at the plasma membrane. Using an electrophysiological assay, we found that OsAKT2 operated as a weakly rectifying K+ channel, preventing H+ /sucrose-symport-induced membrane depolarization. Three critical amino acid residues (K193, N206 and S326) are essential to the phosphorylation-mediated gating change of OsAKT2, consistent with the roles of the corresponding sites in AtAKT2. Disruption of OsAKT2 results in delayed growth of rice seedlings under short-day conditions. Interestingly, the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) inhibits OsAKT2-mediated currents (both instantaneous and time-dependent components). Lipid dot-blot assay and liposome-protein binding analysis revealed that PA directly bound with two adjacent arginine residues in the ANK domain of OsAKT2, which is essential to PA-mediated inhibition of OsAKT2. Electrophysiological and phenotypic analyses also showed the PA-mediated inhibition of AtAKT2 and the negative correlation between intrinsic PA level and Arabidopsis growth, suggesting that PA may inhibit AKT2 function to affect plant growth and development. Our results functionally characterize the Shaker K+ channel OsAKT2 and reveal a direct link between phospholipid signaling and plant K+ channel modulation.
NA	Multiple basic amino acid residues contribute to phosphatidic acid-mediated inhibition of rice potassium channel OsAKT2	2020	Plant Signal Behav .	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University , Nanjing, China.	Anionic phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA) behaves as an important second messenger involved in many cellular processes, such as development, cytoskeletal dynamics, vesicle trafficking, and stress response. Recently, it was reported that PA can directly bind with the rice Shaker K+ channel OsAKT2 to inhibit its channel activity. Two adjacent arginine residues (R644 and R645) in ANK domain were identified as a PA-binding site essential to the PA-mediated inhibition of OsAKT2. However, there may be still other PA-binding sites unidentified in OsAKT2. Here, using a PA biosensor (PAleon), we found that the exogenous PA treatment significantly increased the PA level at the plasma membrane of Xenopus oocytes which were used to express OsAKT2 for electrophysiological assays. As reported previously, exogenous PA markedly inhibited OsAKT2 K+ currents. Replacement of two adjacent basic residues (R190 and K191) in the S4 voltage sensor by glycine completely abolished the time-dependent K+ currents of OsAKT2, but this variant was insensitive to PA treatment. In addition, we also identified other two adjacent arginines (R755 and R756) located in the cytosolic domain as a PA-binding site, which were also essential to the PA-mediated inhibition of OsAKT2. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the PA-K+ channel interaction mechanism. Combining the findings here with the previous study, we propose that multiple basic residues (R190/K191, R644/R645, and R755/R756) in different domains of OsAKT2 contribute to PA-mediated regulation of OsAKT2.
NA	Rice shaker potassium channel OsAKT2 positively regulates salt tolerance and grain yield by mediating K + redistribution	2021	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	Maintaining Na+ /K+ homeostasis is a critical feature for plant survival under salt stress, which depends on the operation of Na+ and K+ transporters. Although some K+ transporters mediating root K+ uptake have been reported to be essential to the maintenance of Na+ /K+ homeostasis, the effect of K+ long-distance translocation via phloem on plant salt tolerance remains unclear. Here, we provide physiological and genetic evidence of the involvement of phloem-localized OsAKT2 in rice salt tolerance. OsAKT2 is a K+ channel permeable to K+ but not to Na+ . Under salt stress, a T-DNA knock-out mutant, osakt2 and two CRISPR lines showed a more sensitive phenotype and higher Na+ accumulation than wild type. They also contained more K+ in shoots but less K+ in roots, showing higher Na+ /K+ ratios. Disruption of OsAKT2 decreases K+ concentration in phloem sap and inhibits shoot-to-root redistribution of K+ . In addition, OsAKT2 also regulates the translocation of K+ and sucrose from old leaves to young leaves, and affects grain shape and yield. These results indicate that OsAKT2-mediated K+ redistribution from shoots to roots contributes to maintenance of Na+ /K+ homeostasis and inhibition of root Na+ uptake, providing novel insights into the roles of K+ transporters in plant salt tolerance.
