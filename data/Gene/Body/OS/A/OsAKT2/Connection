OsAKT2	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
