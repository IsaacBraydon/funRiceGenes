OsAKT2	OsHKT1;5|SKC1|OsHKT8|OsHK1;5	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
OsAKT2	OsHKT2;1|OsHKT1	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
OsAKT2	OsHAK21|qSE3	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
OsAKT2	OsHAK21|qSE3	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 Haplotype analysis revealed four key variations associated with salt tolerance, including an SNP (+1605 bp) within OsABCI7 exon, an SSR (-1231 bp) within OsHAK21 promoter, an indel site at OsNHX1 promoter (-822 bp), and an SNP (-1866 bp) within OsAKT2 promoter
OsAKT2	OsHCF222	Natural variations of chlorophyll fluorescence and ion transporter genes influenced the differential response of japonica rice germplasm with different salt tolerances.	 The expression characteristics of chlorophyll fluorescence genes (OsABCI7 and OsHCF222) and ion transporter protein genes (OsHKT1;5, OsHKT2;1, OsHAK21, OsAKT2, OsNHX1, and OsSOS1) were analyzed
