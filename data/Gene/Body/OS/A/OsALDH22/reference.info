China	The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily of NAD(P)+-dependent enzymes, in general, oxidize a wide range of endogenous and exogenous aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids and play an essential role in detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated under the stressed conditions. In order to identify genes required for the stresses responses in the grass crop Oryza sativa, a homologue of ALDH gene (OsALDH22) was isolated and characterized. OsALDH22 is conserved in eukaryotes, shares high homology with the orthologs from aldehyde dehydrogenase subfamily ALDH22. The OsALDH22 encodes a protein of 597 amino acids that in plants exhibit high identity with the orthologs from Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor, Hordeum vulgare and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively, and the conserved amino acid characteristics for ALDHs are present, including the possible NAD+ binding site (F-V-G-S-P-G-V-G), the catalytic site (V-T-L-E-L-G-G-K) and the Cys active site. Semi-quantitative PCR and real-time PCR analysis indicates that OsALDH22 is expressed differentially in different tissues. Various elevated levels of OsALDH22 expression have been detected when the seedlings exposed to abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsALDH22 show elevated stresses tolerance. On the contrary, down-regulation of OsALDH22 in the RNA interference (RNAi) repression transgenic lines manifests declined stresses tolerance.
