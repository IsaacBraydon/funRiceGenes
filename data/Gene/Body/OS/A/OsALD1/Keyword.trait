OsALD1	resistance	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Taken together, we conclude that OsALD1 plays a role in disease resistance response of rice against the infection with rice blast fungus
OsALD1	chloroplast	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsALD1 proteins predominantly localized at the chloroplast in the plant cells
OsALD1	disease	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Taken together, we conclude that OsALD1 plays a role in disease resistance response of rice against the infection with rice blast fungus
OsALD1	blast	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsALD1 mRNA was strongly transcribed in the infected leaves of rice plants by Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus
OsALD1	blast	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Taken together, we conclude that OsALD1 plays a role in disease resistance response of rice against the infection with rice blast fungus
OsALD1	disease resistance	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 Taken together, we conclude that OsALD1 plays a role in disease resistance response of rice against the infection with rice blast fungus
OsALD1	magnaporthe oryzae	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 OsALD1 mRNA was strongly transcribed in the infected leaves of rice plants by Magnaporthe oryzae, the rice blast fungus
OsALD1	resistant	A Rice Gene Homologous to Arabidopsis AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE1 Participates in Disease Resistance Response against Infection with Magnaporthe oryzae.	 GM rice plants over-expressing OsALD1 were resistant to the fungal infection
