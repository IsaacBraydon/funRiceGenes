OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 AGD2 and its close homolog ALD1 (for AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1) encode aminotransferases that act on an overlapping set of amino acids in vitro
OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 However, kinetic parameters indicate that AGD2 and ALD1 may drive the aminotransferase reaction in opposite directions
OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 ALD1-deficient mutants have the opposite phenotypes from agd2-1, showing reduced SA production and increased disease susceptibility
OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 Furthermore, ALD1 transcript levels are elevated in agd2-1 and are induced in the wild type by bacterial pathogen infection
OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 ALD1 is responsible for some of the elevated SA content and a majority of the disease resistance and dwarfism of agd2-1
OsAGD2	OsALD1	Divergent roles in Arabidopsis thaliana development and defense of two homologous genes, aberrant growth and death2 and AGD2-LIKE DEFENSE RESPONSE PROTEIN1, encoding novel aminotransferases	 We suggest that AGD2 synthesizes an important amino acid-derived molecule that promotes development and suppresses defenses, whereas ALD1 generates a related amino acid-derived molecule important for activating defense signaling
