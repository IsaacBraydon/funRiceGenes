OsACS	seedlings	Targeted Mutagenesis of the OsACS Locus Alters Phosphate Deficiency-Induced Adaptive Responses in Rice Seedlings.	 Together, this study provides new insights into the roles of ethylene in Pi-deficiency response in rice seedlings and the isoform-specific function of OsACS genes in this process
OsACS	root	Targeted Mutagenesis of the OsACS Locus Alters Phosphate Deficiency-Induced Adaptive Responses in Rice Seedlings.	 Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi-deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role of ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient condition
OsACS	growth	Targeted Mutagenesis of the OsACS Locus Alters Phosphate Deficiency-Induced Adaptive Responses in Rice Seedlings.	 Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi-deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role of ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient condition
