OsACS	OsACS1	Targeted Mutagenesis of the OsACS Locus Alters Phosphate Deficiency-Induced Adaptive Responses in Rice Seedlings.	 Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi-deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role of ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient condition
