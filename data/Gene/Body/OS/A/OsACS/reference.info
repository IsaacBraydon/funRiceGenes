As a complex wall system in flowering plants, the pollen outer wall mainly contains aliphatic sporopollenin; however, the mechanism for synthesizing these lipidic precursors during pollen development remains less well understood. Here, we report on the function of the rice tapetum-expressing TDR (Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) gene in aliphatic metabolism and its regulatory role during rice pollen development. The observations of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses suggested that pollen wall formation was significantly altered in the tdr mutant. The contents of aliphatic compositions of anther were greatly changed in the tdr mutant revealed by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) testing, particularly less accumulated in fatty acids, primary alcohols, alkanes and alkenes, and an abnormal increase in secondary alcohols with carbon lengths from C29 to C35 in tdr. Microarray data revealed that a group of genes putatively involved in lipid transport and metabolism were significantly altered in the tdr mutant, indicating the critical role of TDR in the formation of the pollen wall. Also, a wide range of genes (236 in total-154 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated) exhibited statistically significant expressional differences between wild-type and tdr. In addition to its function in promoting tapetum PCD, TDR possibly plays crucial regulatory roles in several basic biological processes during rice pollen development.
NA	Targeted Mutagenesis of the OsACS Locus Alters Phosphate Deficiency-Induced Adaptive Responses in Rice Seedlings.	2019	J Exp Bot	Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.	Phosphate (Pi) deficiency severely influences the growth and reproduction of plants. To cope with Pi-deficiency, plants initiate morphological and biochemical adaptive responses upon sensing low Pi in the soil and the plant hormone ethylene plays a crucial role during this process. However, how regulation of ethylene biosynthesis influences the Pi-induced adaptive responses remains unclear. Here, we determine the roles of rice ACC synthases (OsACS), the rate-limiting enzymes in ethylene biosynthesis, in response to Pi-deficiency. Through analysis of tissue-specific expressions of OsACS in response to Pi-deficiency and OsACS mutants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing, we found that two members of the OsACS family, i.e., OsACS1 and OsACS2, are involved but differed in their importance in controlling the remodeling of root system architecture, transcriptional regulation of Pi-starvation-induced genes, and cellular phosphorus homeostasis. Interestingly, in contrast to the known inhibitory role of ethylene on root elongation, both OsACS mutants, especially OsACS1, almost fail to promote lateral root growth in response to Pi-deficiency, demonstrating a stimulatory role of ethylene in lateral root development under Pi-deficient condition. Together, this study provides new insights into the roles of ethylene in Pi-deficiency response in rice seedlings and the isoform-specific function of OsACS genes in this process.
