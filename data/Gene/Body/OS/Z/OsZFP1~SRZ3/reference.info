x030243.pdf	Transgenic analysis of a salt-inhibited OsZFP1 gene from rice	2004	Acta Botanica Sinica	Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Genet & Dev Biol, Plant Biotechnol Lab, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China	OsZFP1 (Oryza sativa zinc finger protein No.1) gene encodes a protein containing three putative Cys(2)/Cys(2)-type zinc-finger domains, and is negatively regulated by salt stress. The plant expression vector carrying the OsZFP1 gene was constructed under the control of 35S promoter in pCAMBIA1300, and then transformed into Arabidopsis plants and rice calli to overexpress OsZFP1 gene. Both the transgenic Arabidopsis plants and the transgenic rice calli were more sensitive to salt treatment than the wild type. This result implies that OsZFP1 gene may function as a repressor, which probably inhibits the expression of some salt-inducible genes. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants also bolted later than wild type plants upon ABA treatment, suggesting that the function of the OsZFP1 gene may be regulated by ABA.
