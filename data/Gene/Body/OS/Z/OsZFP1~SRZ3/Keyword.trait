OsZFP1|SRZ3	 ABA 	Transgenic analysis of a salt-inhibited OsZFP1 gene from rice	 The transgenic Arabidopsis plants also bolted later than wild type plants upon ABA treatment, suggesting that the function of the OsZFP1 gene may be regulated by ABA
OsZFP1|SRZ3	salt	Transgenic analysis of a salt-inhibited OsZFP1 gene from rice	" This result implies that OsZFP1 gene may function as a repressor, which probably inhibits the expression of some salt-inducible genes|Transgenic analysis of a salt-inhibited OsZFP1 gene from rice"
