OsF5HL	OsF5HL2	Cloning, characterization, and expression of two cDNA clones for a rice ferulate-5-hydroxylase gene, a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase	 We have isolated twoF5H genes,OsF5HL andOsF5HL2, from a japonica-type rice (Oryza sativa L| Alignments of theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 cDNAs to their genomic DNAs revealed thatOsF5HL has an open reading frame (ORF) of 1590 b from four exons, whileOsF5HL2 has an ORF of 1560 b from two exons| Expression ofOsFSHL is highest in young leaves, whereas that ofOsF5HL2 is greatest in mature leaves| These data suggest that theOsF5HL andOsF5HL2 genes belong to theCYP84 subfamily and that their expressions are tissue-specific
