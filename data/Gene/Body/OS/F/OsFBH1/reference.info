Ito-2012-FLOWERING BHLH trans.pdf	FLOWERING BHLH transcriptional activators control expression of the photoperiodic flowering regulator CONSTANS in Arabidopsis	2012	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Department of Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1800, USA.	Many plants monitor day-length changes throughout the year and use the information to precisely regulate the timing of seasonal flowering for maximum reproductive success. In Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptional regulation of the CONSTANS (CO) gene and posttranslational regulation of CO protein are crucial mechanisms for proper day-length measurement in photoperiodic flowering. Currently, the CYCLING DOF FACTOR proteins are the only transcription factors known to directly regulate CO gene expression, and the mechanisms that directly activate CO transcription have remained unknown. Here we report the identification of four CO transcriptional activators, named FLOWERING BHLH 1 (FBH1), FBH2, FBH3, and FBH4. All FBH proteins are related basic helix-loop-helix-type transcription factors that preferentially bind to the E-box cis-elements in the CO promoter. Overexpression of all FBH genes drastically elevated CO levels and caused early flowering regardless of photoperiod, whereas CO levels were reduced in the fbh quadruple mutants. In addition, FBH1 is expressed in the vascular tissue and bound near the transcription start site of the CO promoter in vivo. Furthermore, FBH homologs in poplar and rice induced CO expression in Arabidopsis. These results indicate that FBH proteins positively regulate CO transcription for photoperiodic flowering and that this mechanism may be conserved in diverse plant species. Our results suggest that the diurnal CO expression pattern is generated by a concert of redundant functions of positive and negative transcriptional regulators.
NA	Two interacting basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors control flowering time in rice.	2022	Plant Physiol	Rice Research Institute, Shenyang Agricultural University, 120 Dongling Road, Shenhe District, Shenyang 110866, China.	Flowering time is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting the adaptation and yield of rice (Oryza sativa). Heading date 1 (Hd1) is a key factor in the photoperiodic control of flowering time. In this study, two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, Hd1 Binding Protein 1 (HBP1) and Partner of HBP1 (POH1) were identified as transcriptional regulators of Hd1. We generated knockout mutants of HBP1 and ectopically expressed transgenic lines of the two bHLH transcription factors and used these lines to investigate the roles of these two factors in regulating flowering time. HBP1 physically associated or heterodimers to perform their functions. Both HBP1 and POH1 bound directly to the cis-acting elements located in the promoter of Hd1 to activate its expression. CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice. Our findings revealed a mechanism for flowering time control through transcriptional regulation of Hd1 and laid theoretical and practical foundations for improving the growth period, adaptation, and yield of rice.
