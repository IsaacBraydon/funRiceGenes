OsFBH1|POH1	 Both HBP1 and POH1 bound directly to the cis-acting elements located in the promoter of Hd1 to activate its expression |  CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice	 CRISPR/Cas9-generated knockout mutations of HBP1, but not POH1 mutations, promoted earlier flowering time; conversely, HBP1 and POH1 overexpression delayed flowering time in rice under long-day and short-day conditions by activating the expression of Hd1 and suppressing the expression of Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Heading date 3a (Hd3a), and Rice Flowering locus T 1 (RFT1), thus controlling flowering time in rice
