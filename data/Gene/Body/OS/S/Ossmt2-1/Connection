Ossmt1-1	Ossmt2-1	Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis	We now report the comparison of two cDNAs isolated from Nicotiana tabacum, Ntsmt1-1 which belongs to the first SMT cDNA family and Ntsmt2-1 which belongs to the second
Ossmt1-1	Ossmt2-1	Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis	Whereas erg6 is devoid of 24-alkyl sterols, erg6 Ntsmt1-1 contained a majority of 24-methylene sterols and erg6 Ntsmt2-1, a majority of 24-ethylidene sterols, indicating distinct functions for the expression products of these cDNAs
Ossmt1-1	Ossmt2-1	Two families of sterol methyltransferases are involved in the first and the second methylation steps of plant sterol biosynthesis	tabacum, one (Ntsmt1-1) belongs to the first family of plant SMT cDNAs according to its deduced amino acid sequence and was shown to encode a cycloartenol C24 methyltransferase, whereas another (Ntsmt2-1) belongs to the second family and was shown to encode a 24-methylene lophenol C24 methyltransferase
