In the present study, TaSTE (wheat), the ortholog of AtSTE1 (Arabidopsis), was cloned and mapped to wheat chromosome homologous group 3 in the interval between simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers CWM48.1 and WMC532, with genetic distances of 17.7 and 7.6 cM, respectively. Both linkage and association analyses revealed that TaSTE-A1 was significantly associated with plant height in bread wheat. In silico expression results showed similar expression patterns among TaSTE, HvSTE1 (barley), OsSTE1 (also known as OsDWF7 in rice), and AtSTE1, suggesting that these orthologs might share common functions among wheat, barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. The haplotype frequencies in wild species, landraces, and modern cultivars indicated that haplotype II (Hap II) was associated with reduced plant height and positively selected during modern breeding improvement. One pair of complementary allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers can distinguish haplotype I (Hap I) and Hap II and could be developed to assist selection in wheat architecture breeding.
