OsNMCP1	OsSWI3C|OsCHB705|CHB705	A lamin-like protein OsNMCP1 regulates drought resistance and root growth through chromatin accessibility modulation by interacting with a chromatin remodeler OsSWI3C in rice.	 The reported drought resistance or root growth related genes that were positively regulated by OsNMCP1 were negatively regulated by OsSWI3C under drought stress conditions, and OsSWI3C overexpression led to decreased drought resistance
