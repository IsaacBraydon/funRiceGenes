ncb1892.pdf	OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice	2009	Nat Cell Biol	Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, China.	Plants show distinct morphologies in different light conditions through a process called photomorphogenesis. A predominant feature of photomorphogenesis is the reduced growth of seedlings under light conditions compared with darkness. For this adaptive event, the most well-known molecular mechanism involves photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of cell elongation. However, it is not known whether additional pathways exist. Here, we describe a newly discovered pathway of light-modulated plant growth mediated by the halotolerance protein HAL3, a flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding protein involved in cell division. We found that light, especially blue light, suppresses growth of rice seedlings by reducing the activity of Oryza sativa (Os) HAL3. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that OsHAL3 is structurally inactivated by light through photo-oxidation and by direct interaction with photons. In addition, the transcriptional expression of OsHAL3 is synergistically regulated by different light conditions. Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity. Our results uncover a new mechanism for light-regulated plant growth, namely, light not only inhibits cell elongation but also suppresses cell division through HAL3 and E3 ubiquitin ligase. This study thus brings new insights into our understanding of plant photomorphogenesis.
NA	The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.	2015	Plant Cell	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	The photoperiodic response is one of the most important factors determining heading date in rice (Oryza sativa). Although rhythmic expression patterns of flowering time genes have been reported to fine-tune the photoperiodic response, posttranslational regulation of key flowering regulators has seldom been elucidated in rice. Heading date 1 (Hd1) encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the photoperiodic response, which determines rice regional adaptability. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of Hd1 accumulation during the photoperiod response. Here, we identify a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, Heading date Associated Factor 1 (HAF1), which physically interacts with Hd1. HAF1 mediates ubiquitination and targets Hd1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. The haf1 mutant exhibits a later flowering heading date under both short-day and long-day conditions. In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions. Moreover, high levels of Hd1 accumulate in haf1. Our results suggest that HAF1 is essential to precise modulation of the timing of Hd1 accumulation during the photoperiod response in rice.
NA	HAF1 Modulates Circadian Accumulation of OsELF3 Controlling Heading Date Under Long-day Conditions in Rice.	2018	Plant Cell	Huazhong Agricultural University CITY: Wuhan China [CN].	The ubiquitin 26S proteasome system (UPS) is critical for enabling plants to alter their proteomes to integrate internal and external signals for the photoperiodic induction of flowering. We previously demonstrated that HAF1, a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential to precisely modulate the timing of Heading Date1 accumulation and to ensure appropriate photoperiodic responses under short-day conditions in rice (Oryza sativa). However, how HAF1 mediates flowering under long-day conditions remains unknown. In this study, we show that OsELF3 (EARLY FLOWERING3) is the direct substrate of HAF1 for ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. HAF1 is required for maintaining the circadian rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation during photoperiodic responses in rice. In addition, the haf1 oself3 double mutant headed as late as oself3 plants under long-day conditions. An amino acid variation (L558S) within the interaction domain of OsELF3 with HAF1 greatly contributes to the variation in heading date among japonica rice accessions. Japonica accessions carrying the OsELF3(L) type allele are found at higher latitudes, while varieties carrying the OsELF3(S) type allele are found at lower latitudes. Taken together, our findings suggest that HAF1 precisely modulates the diurnal rhythm of OsELF3 accumulation to ensure the appropriate heading date in rice.
