OsHOL1	OsHOL2	Arabidopsis HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER Protein Methylates a Glucosinolate Breakdown Product and Functions in Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola	 Our previous studies demonstrated that AtHOL1 and its homologs, AtHOL2 and AtHOL3, have S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activities
OsHOL1	OsHOL2	Arabidopsis HARMLESS TO OZONE LAYER Protein Methylates a Glucosinolate Breakdown Product and Functions in Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola	 Analyses with the T-DNA insertion Arabidopsis mutants (hol1, hol2, and hol3) revealed that only hol1 showed increased sensitivity to NCS(-) in medium and a concomitant lack of CH(3)SCN synthesis upon tissue damage
