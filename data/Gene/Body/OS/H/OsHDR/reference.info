Okada-2007-Elicitor induced act.pdf	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo, Japan.	Diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced via geranylgeranyl diphosphate in suspension-cultured rice cells after treatment with a chitin elicitor. We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1, EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression (LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.
NA	Disruption of a Rice Chloroplast-Targeted Gene OsHMBPP Causes a Seedling-Lethal Albino Phenotype	2020	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Eco-Agricultural Biotechnology around Hongze Lake, Regional Cooperative Innovation Center for Modern Agriculture and Environmental Protection, Huaiyin Normal University, Huaian, 223300, China. 1240623244@qq.com.	Background: Chloroplast development is coordinately regulated by plastid- and nuclear-encoding genes. Although many regulators have been reported to be involved in chloroplast development, new factors remain to be identified, given the complexity of this process.  Results: In this study, we characterized a rice mutant lethal albinic seedling 1(las1)form of a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (OsHMBPP) that was targeted to the chloroplasts. The LAS1 mutation caused the albino lethal phenotype in seedlings. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that las1 were defective in early chloroplast development. LAS1 is preferentially expressed in leaves, implying its role in controlling chloroplast development. The expression levels of many chloroplast-encoded genes were altered significantly in las1. The expression levels of nuclear-encoded gene involved in Chl biosynthesis were also decreased in las1. We further investigated plastidic RNA editing in las1 and found that the edit efficiency of four chloroplast genes were markly altered. Compared with WT, las1 exhibited defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes.  Conclusions: Our results show that LAS1/OsHMBPP plays an essential role in the early chloroplast development in rice.
NA	Differential Regulation of an OsIspH1, the Functional 4-Hydroxy-3-Methylbut-2-Enyl Diphosphate Reductase, for Photosynthetic Pigment Biosynthesis in Rice Leaves and Seeds.	2022	Front Plant Sci	Department of Genetics and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Biotechnology, College of Life Sciences, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, South Korea.	The methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway is responsible for providing common precursors for the biosynthesis of diverse plastidial terpenoids, including chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phytohormones, in plants. In rice (Oryza sativa), the last-step genes encoding 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase [HDR/isoprenoid synthesis H (IspH)] have been annotated in two genes (OsIspH1 and OsIspH2) in the rice genome. The spatial transcript levels indicated that OsIspH1 is highly expressed in all tissues at different developmental stages, whereas OsIspH2 is barely expressed due to an early stop in exon 1 caused by splicing error. OsIspH1 localized into plastids and osisph1, a T-DNA inserted knockout mutant, showed an albino phenotype, indicating that OsIspH1 is the only functional gene. To elucidate the role of OsIspH1 in the MEP pathway, we created two single (H145P and K407R) and double (H145P/K407R) mutations and performed complementation tests in two hdr mutants, including Escherichia coli DLYT1 strains and osisph1 rice plants. The results showed that every single mutation retained HDR function, but a double mutation lost it, proposing that the complementary relations of two residues might be important for enzyme activity but not each residue. When overexpressed in rice plants, the double-mutated gene, OsIspH1(MUT) , reduced chlorophyll and carotenoid biosynthesis in the leaves and seeds. It confirmed the crucial role of OsIspH1 in plastidic terpenoid biosynthesis, revealing organ-specific differential regulation of OsIspH1 in rice plants.
