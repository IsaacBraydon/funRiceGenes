Okada-2007-Elicitor induced act.pdf	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	2007	Plant Mol Biol	Biotechnology Research Center, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo, Japan.	Diterpenoid phytoalexins such as momilactones and phytocassanes are produced via geranylgeranyl diphosphate in suspension-cultured rice cells after treatment with a chitin elicitor. We have previously shown that the production of diterpene hydrocarbons leading to phytoalexins and the expression of related biosynthetic genes are activated in suspension-cultured rice cells upon elicitor treatment. To better understand the elicitor-induced activation of phytoalexin biosynthesis, we conducted microarray analysis using suspension-cultured rice cells collected at various times after treatment with chitin elicitor. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed two types of early-induced expression (EIE-1, EIE-2) nodes and a late-induced expression (LIE) node that includes genes involved in phytoalexins biosynthesis. The LIE node contains genes that may be responsible for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, a plastidic biosynthetic pathway for isopentenyl diphosphate, an early precursor of phytoalexins. The elicitor-induced expression of these putative MEP pathway genes was confirmed by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E. coli mutants disrupted in the corresponding genes. Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor. These results suggest that activation of the MEP pathway is required to supply sufficient terpenoid precursors for the production of phytoalexins in infected rice plants.
NA	Disruption of a Rice Chloroplast-Targeted Gene OsHMBPP Causes a Seedling-Lethal Albino Phenotype	2020	Rice (N Y)	Key Laboratory of Eco-Agricultural Biotechnology around Hongze Lake, Regional Cooperative Innovation Center for Modern Agriculture and Environmental Protection, Huaiyin Normal University, Huaian, 223300, China. 1240623244@qq.com.	Background: Chloroplast development is coordinately regulated by plastid- and nuclear-encoding genes. Although many regulators have been reported to be involved in chloroplast development, new factors remain to be identified, given the complexity of this process.  Results: In this study, we characterized a rice mutant lethal albinic seedling 1(las1)form of a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (OsHMBPP) that was targeted to the chloroplasts. The LAS1 mutation caused the albino lethal phenotype in seedlings. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that las1 were defective in early chloroplast development. LAS1 is preferentially expressed in leaves, implying its role in controlling chloroplast development. The expression levels of many chloroplast-encoded genes were altered significantly in las1. The expression levels of nuclear-encoded gene involved in Chl biosynthesis were also decreased in las1. We further investigated plastidic RNA editing in las1 and found that the edit efficiency of four chloroplast genes were markly altered. Compared with WT, las1 exhibited defective in biogenesis of chloroplast ribosomes.  Conclusions: Our results show that LAS1/OsHMBPP plays an essential role in the early chloroplast development in rice.
