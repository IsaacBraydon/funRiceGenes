OsASHL1	OsVIL4	OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, two members of the COMPASS-like complex, control floral transition and plant development in rice.	 Lower expression of Ehd1, OsVIL4, and OsMADS51 in the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant background accompanies a delayed vegetative growth phase and photoperiod-sensitive phase compared with that in wild type
OsASHL1	OsVIL4	OsASHL1 and OsASHL2, two members of the COMPASS-like complex, control floral transition and plant development in rice.	 Consistent with this result, knockout of OsVIL4 gives rise to a late-flowering phenotype similar to that of the osashl1 osashl2 double mutant, suggesting that OsVIL4 is a target of the COMPASS-like complex
