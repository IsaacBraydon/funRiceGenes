Mismatch repair (MMR) is a conservative pathway for maintaining the genome integrity of different organisms. Although suppression of MMR has resulted in various mutation phenotypes in Arabidopsis, the use of this strategy for mutation breeding in major crops has not been reported. Here, we overexpressed a truncated version of the OsPMS1 protein in rice; this approach is expected to suppress the rice MMR system through a dominant negative mechanism. We observed a wide spectrum of mutation phenotypes in the progeny of the transgenic plants during seed germination and the plant growth stages. Genomic variations were detected with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), and sequencing of the differential ISSR bands revealed that the mutation occurred as a point mutation or as microsatellite instability at high frequencies. Plant lines with agronomically important traits, such as salt and drought tolerance, various tiller number, and early flowering, were obtained. Furthermore, we obtained mutants with important traits that are free of the transgene. Together, these results demonstrate that MMR suppression can be used as an efficient strategy for mutation breeding in rice.
NA	Rice MutL¦Ã, the MLH1-MLH3 heterodimer, participates in the formation of type I crossovers and regulation of embryo sac fertility	2021	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center, Changsha, China.	The development of embryo sacs is crucial for seed production in plants, but the genetic basis regulating the meiotic crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells remains largely unclear. Here, we report the characterization of a spontaneous rice female sterile variation 1 mutant (fsv1) that showed severe embryo sacs abortion with low seed-setting rate. Through map-based cloning and functional analyses, we isolated the causal gene of fsv1, OsMLH3 encoding a MutL-homolog 3 protein, an ortholog of HvMLH3 in barley and AtMLH3 in Arabidopsis. OsMLH3 and OsMLH1 (MutL-homolog 1) interact to form a heterodimer (MutL¦Ã) to promote crossover formation in the macrospore and microspore mother cells and development of functional megaspore during meiosis, defective OsMLH3 or OsMLH1 in fsv1 and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout lines results in reduced type I crossover and bivalent frequency. The fsv1 and OsMLH3-knockout lines are valuable germplasms for development of female sterile restorer lines for mechanized seed production of hybrid rice.
NA	OsMLH1 interacts with OsMLH3 to regulate synapsis and interference-sensitive crossover formation during meiosis in rice	2021	J Genet Genomics	National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, National Center of Plant Gene Research (Wuhan), Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, China.	Meiotic recombination is essential for reciprocal exchange of genetic information between homologous chromosomes and their subsequent proper segregation in sexually reproducing organisms. MLH1 and MLH3 belong to meiosis-specific members of the MutL-homolog family, which are required for normal level of crossovers (COs) in some eukaryotes. However, their functions in plants need to be further elucidated. Here, we report the identification of OsMLH1 and reveal its functions during meiosis in rice. Using CRISPR-Cas9 approach, two independent mutants, Osmlh1-1 and Osmlh1-2, were generated and exhibited significantly reduced male fertility. In Osmlh1-1, the clearance of PAIR2 was delayed and partial ZEP1 proteins were not loaded into the chromosomes, which might be due to the deficient in resolution of interlocks at late zygotene. Thus, OsMLH1 is required for the assembly of synapsis complex. In Osmlh1-1, CO number was dropped by ~53% and the distribution of residual COs was consistent with predicted Poisson distribution, indicating that OsMLH1 is essential for the formation of interference-sensitive COs (class I COs). OsMLH1 interacts with OsMLH3 through their C-terminal domains. Mutation in OsMLH3 also affects the pollen fertility. Thus, our experiments reveal that the conserved heterodimer MutL¦Ã (OsMLH1-OsMLH3) is essential for the formation of class I COs in rice.
NA	A retrotransposon insertion in MUTL-HOMOLOG 1 affects wild rice seed set and cultivated rice crossover rate.	2022	Plant Physiol	College of Life Sciences, Anhui Normal University, Wuhu, Anhui, 241000, China.	Wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) has a lower panicle seed setting rate (PSSR) and gamete fertility than domesticated rice (O. sativa), but the genetic mechanisms of this phenomenon remain unknown. Here, we cloned a null allele of OsMLH1, an orthologue of MutL-homolog 1 to yeast and mammals, from wild rice O. rufipogon W1943 and revealed a 5.4-kb retrotransposon insertion in OsMLH1 is responsible for the low PSSR in wild rice. In contrast to the wild type, a near isogenic line NIL-mlh1 exhibits defective crossover formation during meiosis, resulting in reduced pollen viability, partial embryo lethality and low PSSR. Except for the mutant of mismatch repair gene post-meiotic segregation 1 (Ospms1), all other MutL mutants from O. sativa indica subspecies displayed male and female semi-sterility similar to NIL-mlh1, but less severe than those from O. sativa japonica subspecies. MLH1 and MLH3 did not contribute in an additive fashion to fertility. Two types of MutL heterodimers, MLH1-PMS1 and MLH1-MLH3, were identified in rice, but only the latter functions in promoting meiotic crossover formation. Compared to japonica varieties, indica cultivars had greater numbers of crossover events per meiosis. Our results suggest that low fertility in wild rice may be caused by different gene defects, and indica and japonica subspecies have substantially different crossover rates responsible for the discrepancy between the fertility of mlh1 and mlh3 mutants.
