J. Exp. Bot.-2007-Cheung-4147-59.pdf	Expression of a RING-HC protein from rice improves resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana	2007	J Exp Bot	Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR.	A cDNA clone (OsRHC1) was obtained, which encodes a novel RING zinc finger protein sharing similar structural features (multiple transmembrane domains at the N-half; a unique RING zinc finger consensus Cys-X(2)-Cys-X(11)-Cys-X-His-X(3)-Cys-X(2)-Cys-X(6)-Cys-X(2)-Cys at the C terminus) to a group of closely related annotated proteins from both monocots and dicots. OsRHC1 was found to be localized on plasma membrane of rice cells and induced by wounding in rice lines containing Xa loci. Ecotopic expression of the OsRHC1 cDNA from rice (a monocot) in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana (a dicot) enhanced the defence response toward Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, suggesting that OsRHC1 may confer broad-spectrum disease resistance. The protective effects were neutralized in the presence of MG132 or in an npr1-3 mutation background, indicating that the function of OsRHC1 is dependent on the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation via the 26S proteasome and the presence of the key defence response regulator NPR1.
NA	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2019	Rice (N Y)	Department of Plant Science and Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Sciences, and Plant Genomics and Breeding Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, South Korea.	Although embryo accounts for only 2-3% of the total weight of a rice grain, it is a good source of various nutrients for human health. Because enlarged embryo size causes increase of the amount of nutrients and bioactive compounds stored within rice grain, giant embryo mutants of rice (Oryza sativa L.) are excellent genetic resources for improving the nutritional value of rice grains.Three giant embryo mutants, including large embryo (le), giant embryo (ge) and super-giant embryo (ges), with variable embryo size were used in this study. We investigated whether genes controlling embryo size in these mutants (le, ge and ges) were allelic to each other. Although ge and ges was allelic to GIANT EMBRY (GE), le was not allelic to ge and ges in allelism test. The GE gene carried a unique nucleotide substitution in each of the two mutants (ge and ges), resulting in non-synonymous mutations in exon 2 of GE in both mutants. However, the GE gene of the le mutant did not carry any mutation, suggesting that the enlarged embryo phenotype of le was governed by another gene. Using map-based cloning, we mapped the LE gene to the short arm of chromosome 3. The le mutant showed mild enlargement in embryo size, which resulted from an increase in the size of scutellar parenchyma cells. The LE encodes a C3HC4-type RING finger protein and was expressed to relatively high levels in seeds at a late developmental stage. Knockdown of LE expression using RNA interference increased the embryo size of rice grains, confirming the role of LE in determining the embryo size.Overall, we identified a new gene controlling embryo size in rice. Phenotypic and molecular characterization results suggest that the le mutant will serve as a valuable resource for developing new rice cultivars with large embryos and nutrient-dense grains.
NA	A genetic module at one locus in rice protects chloroplasts to enhance thermotolerance.	2022	Science	National Key Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, CAS Centre for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Shanghai Institute of Plant Physiology and Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.	How the plasma membrane senses external heat-stress signals to communicate with chloroplasts to orchestrate thermotolerance remains elusive. We identified a quantitative trait locus, Thermo-tolerance 3 (TT3), consisting of two genes, TT3.1 and TT3.2, that interact together to enhance rice thermotolerance and reduce grain-yield losses caused by heat stress. Upon heat stress, plasma membrane-localized E3 ligase TT3.1 translocates to the endosomes, on which TT3.1 ubiquitinates chloroplast precursor protein TT3.2 for vacuolar degradation, implying that TT3.1 might serve as a potential thermosensor. Lesser accumulated, mature TT3.2 proteins in chloroplasts are essential for protecting thylakoids from heat stress. Our findings not only reveal a TT3.1-TT3.2 genetic module at one locus that transduces heat signals from plasma membrane to chloroplasts but also provide the strategy for breeding highly thermotolerant crops.
NA	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	2022	Plant Cell	College of Life Science, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	Grain size is an important agronomic trait, but our knowledge about grain size determination in crops is still limited. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) is a special ubiquitin proteasome system that is involved in degrading misfolded or incompletely folded proteins in the ER. Here, we report that SMALL GRAIN 3 (SMG3) and DECREASED GRAIN SIZE 1 (DGS1), an ERAD-related E2-E3 enzyme pair, regulate grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway in rice (Oryza sativa). SMG3 encodes a homolog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UBIQUITIN CONJUGATING ENZYME 32, which is a conserved ERAD-associated E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. SMG3 interacts with another grain size regulator, DGS1. Loss of function of SMG3 or DGS1 results in small grains, while overexpression of SMG3 or DGS1 leads to long grains. Further analyses showed that DGS1 is an active E3 ubiquitin ligase and colocates with SMG3 in the ER. SMG3 and DGS1 are involved in BR signaling. DGS1 ubiquitinates the BR receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1) and affects its accumulation. Genetic analysis suggests that SMG3, DGS1, and BRI1 act together to regulate grain size and weight. In summary, our findings identify an ERAD-related E2-E3 pair that regulates grain size and weight, which gives insight into the function of ERAD in grain size control and BR signaling.
NA	An E2-E3 pair contributes to seed size control in grain crops.	2023	Nat Commun	Institute of Crop Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, 100081, China.	Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate grain yield is important for improving agricultural productivity. Protein ubiquitination controls various aspects of plant growth but lacks understanding on how E2-E3 enzyme pairs impact grain yield in major crops. Here, we identified a RING-type E3 ligase SGD1 and its E2 partner SiUBC32 responsible for grain yield control in Setaria italica. The conserved role of SGD1 was observed in wheat, maize, and rice. Furthermore, SGD1 ubiquitinates the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, stabilizing it and promoting plant growth. Overexpression of an elite SGD1 haplotype improved grain yield by about 12.8% per plant, and promote complex biological processes such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, stress responses, photosystem stabilization, and nitrogen metabolism. Our research not only identifies the SiUBC32-SGD1-BRI1 genetic module that contributes to grain yield improvement but also provides a strategy for exploring key genes controlling important traits in Poaceae crops using the Setaria model system.
