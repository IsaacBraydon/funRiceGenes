GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	Three giant embryo mutants, including large embryo (le), giant embryo (ge) and super-giant embryo (ges), with variable embryo size were used in this study
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 We investigated whether genes controlling embryo size in these mutants (le, ge and ges) were allelic to each other
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Although ge and ges was allelic to GIANT EMBRY (GE), le was not allelic to ge and ges in allelism test
GE|CYP78A13	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 However, the GE gene of the le mutant did not carry any mutation, suggesting that the enlarged embryo phenotype of le was governed by another gene
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 Here, we report that SMALL GRAIN 3 (SMG3) and DECREASED GRAIN SIZE 1 (DGS1), an ERAD-related E2-E3 enzyme pair, regulate grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway in rice (Oryza sativa)
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 SMG3 interacts with another grain size regulator, DGS1
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 Loss of function of SMG3 or DGS1 results in small grains, while overexpression of SMG3 or DGS1 leads to long grains
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 Further analyses showed that DGS1 is an active E3 ubiquitin ligase and colocates with SMG3 in the ER
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 SMG3 and DGS1 are involved in BR signaling
Osmyb3|SG3|SMG3	OsRHC1|LE|TT3.1|DGS1|OsSGD1	An endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation-related E2-E3 enzyme pair controls grain size and weight through the brassinosteroid signaling pathway in rice.	 Genetic analysis suggests that SMG3, DGS1, and BRI1 act together to regulate grain size and weight
