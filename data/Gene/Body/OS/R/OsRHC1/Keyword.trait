OsRHC1|LE	disease resistance	Expression of a RING-HC protein from rice improves resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana	tomato DC3000, suggesting that OsRHC1 may confer broad-spectrum disease resistance
OsRHC1|LE	disease	Expression of a RING-HC protein from rice improves resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana	tomato DC3000, suggesting that OsRHC1 may confer broad-spectrum disease resistance
OsRHC1|LE	map-based cloning	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 Using map-based cloning, we mapped the LE gene to the short arm of chromosome 3
OsRHC1|LE	R protein	Identification and Characterization of LARGE EMBRYO, a New Gene Controlling Embryo Size in Rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The LE encodes a C3HC4-type RING finger protein and was expressed to relatively high levels in seeds at a late developmental stage
