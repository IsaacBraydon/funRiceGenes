Kobayashi-2005-Expression of iron-a.pdf	Expression of iron-acquisition-related genes in iron-deficient rice is co-ordinately induced by partially conserved iron-deficiency-responsive elements	2005	J Exp Bot	Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.	Rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) utilize the iron chelators known as mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) to acquire iron from the rhizosphere. Synthesis of MAs and uptake of MA-chelated iron are strongly induced under conditions of iron deficiency. Microarray analysis was used to characterize the expression profile of rice in response to iron deficiency at the genomic level. mRNA extracted from iron-deficient or iron-sufficient rice roots or leaves was hybridized to a rice array containing 8987 cDNA clones. An induction ratio of greater than 2.0 in roots was observed for 57 genes, many of which are involved in iron-uptake mechanisms, including every identified or predicted step in the methionine cycle and the biosynthesis of MAs from methionine. Northern analysis confirmed that the expression of genes encoding every step in the methionine cycle is thoroughly induced by iron deficiency in roots, and almost thoroughly induced in leaves. A promoter search revealed that the iron-deficiency-induced genes related to iron uptake possessed sequences homologous to the iron-deficiency-responsive cis-acting elements IDE1 and IDE2 in their promoter regions, at a higher rate than that showing no induction under Fe deficiency. These results suggest that rice genes involved in iron acquisition are co-ordinately regulated by conserved mechanisms in response to iron deficiency, in which IDE-mediated regulation plays a significant role.
pce2569.pdf	Identification of OsbHLH133 as a regulator of iron distribution between roots and shoots in Oryza sativa	2013	Plant Cell Environ	State Key Laboratory of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry Joint Research Laboratory in Genomics and Nutriomics, College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.	Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth. Regulation of Fe-deficiency signalling networks is one of the many functions reported for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in plants. In the present study, OsbHLH133 was found to be induced by Fe-deficiency conditions in Oryza sativa. Insertional inactivation of OsbHLH133 (bhlh133) resulted in growth retardation, with enhanced Fe concentration seen in shoots, and reduced Fe concentration in roots. Overexpression of OsbHLH133 had the opposite effect, that is resulted in an enhanced Fe concentration in roots and reduced Fe concentration in shoots and also in xylem sap. Microarray analysis showed that some of the genes encoding Fe-related functions were up-regulated under Fe-sufficient conditions, in bhlh133 mutant plants compared to wild-type plants. Significant differential expression of a number of signalling pathways, including calcium signalling, was also seen in bhlh133 plants compared to wild-type plants, independent of Fe conditions.
