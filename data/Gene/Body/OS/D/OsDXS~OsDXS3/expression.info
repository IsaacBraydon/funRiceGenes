OsDXS|OsDXS3	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed |  Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
