OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E
OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor
OsDXS|OsDXS3	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.	A subsequent transactivation assay further confirmed the direct regulation of OsDXS3 expression by OsTGAP1, but other MEP pathway genes were not included among the OsTGAP1 target genes
OsDXS|OsDXS3	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	OsTGAP1 is responsible for JA-inducible diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis in rice roots with biological impacts on allelopathic interaction.	 Reporter analysis in planta revealed that OsTGAP1 activated the promoters of OsDXS3 and momilactone biosynthetic gene OsKSL4, presumably through binding to the TGACGT motif
OsDTC2|OsKSL11	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 A common expression pattern was highlighted for four genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900) were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was significantly repressed
OsDXS|OsDXS3	PR1b	Identification of a small set of genes commonly regulated in rice roots in response to beneficial rhizobacteria	 Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions
