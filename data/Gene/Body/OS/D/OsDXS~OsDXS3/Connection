OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E
OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor
OsDXS|OsDXS3	OsTGAP1|OsbZIP37	Identification of target genes of the bZIP transcription factor OsTGAP1, whose overexpression causes elicitor-induced hyperaccumulation of diterpenoid phytoalexins in rice cells.	A subsequent transactivation assay further confirmed the direct regulation of OsDXS3 expression by OsTGAP1, but other MEP pathway genes were not included among the OsTGAP1 target genes
