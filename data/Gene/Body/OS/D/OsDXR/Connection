OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	 1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E| Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor
