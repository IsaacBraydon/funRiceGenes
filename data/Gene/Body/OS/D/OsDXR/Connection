OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	1-Deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D: -xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR), and 4-(cytidine 5'-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-D: -erythritol synthase (CMS), which catalyze the first three committed steps in the MEP pathway, were further shown to have enzymatic activities that complement the growth of E
OsDXR	OsDXS|OsDXS3	Elicitor induced activation of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway toward phytoalexins biosynthesis in rice	Application of ketoclomazone and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of DXS and DXR, respectively, repressed the accumulation of diterpene-type phytoalexins in suspension cells treated with chitin elicitor
OsDXR	OsFBN1	Overexpressing OsFBN1 enhances plastoglobule formation, reduces grain-filling percent and jasmonate levels under heat stress in rice.	 Moreover, overexpressing OsFBN1 affected the transcription levels of OsAOS2 in JA synthesis, OsTHF1, OsABC1K7 and OsPsaE in thylakoid stability and photosynthesis, OsABC1-4 and OsSPS2 in ubiquinone-metabolism, OsHDR, OsDXR, and OsFPPS in isoprenoid metabolism
CLA1|OsDXS1|OsDXS2	OsDXR	The organ-specific differential roles of rice DXS and DXR, the first two enzymes of the MEP pathway, in carotenoid metabolism in Oryza sativa leaves and seeds.	3-fold relative to non-transgenic (NT) seeds, while the overexpression of each OsDXS2 or OsDXR caused no positive effect on the accumulation of either carotenoids or chlorophylls in leaves and seeds, suggesting that OsDXS2 functions as a rate-limiting enzyme supplying IPP/DMAPPs to seed carotenoid metabolism, but OsDXR doesn&#39;t in either leaves or seeds
CLA1|OsDXS1|OsDXS2	OsDXR	The organ-specific differential roles of rice DXS and DXR, the first two enzymes of the MEP pathway, in carotenoid metabolism in Oryza sativa leaves and seeds.	 These non-proportional expression patterns in leaves and seeds suggest that those metabolic changes of carotenoids were associated with overexpression of the OsDXS2, OsDXR and stPAC transgenes, and the capacities of the intermediate biosynthetic enzymes might be much more important for those metabolic alterations than the transcript levels of intermediate biosynthetic genes are
