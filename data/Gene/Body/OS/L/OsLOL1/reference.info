Rice LSD1-like (OsLOL1) gene was involved in regulation of cell death and OsLOL 2 (rice zinc-finger gene) has been reported to regulate plant growth and disease resistance in plants. Bacterial-wilt is a devastating disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum that needs to be controlled effectively. To achieve this purpose, Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic tobacco plants were generated, which hold OsLOL 2 gene in their genome encoding zinc-finger proteins. Selection of the T2 OsLOL2 transgenic lines was accomplished using molecular techniques, and later on their physiological characterization was done. Southern-blot assay of the selected transformed lines reveals that the transgene has been incorporated into the tobacco genome. On infection with R. solanacearum strains (GMI1000 and RS1000), the selected T2 transgenic tobacco lines showed enhanced resistance against bacterial-wilt when compared to control plants. Moreover, relatively less bacterial proliferation occurred in the infected stem-tissues of the transgenic lines. Owing to smaller bacterial populations, relatively fewer blockages in xylem vessels were observed during microscopy in the transgenic lines as compared to control.
NA	OsLOL1, a C2C2-type zinc finger protein, interacts with OsbZIP58 to promote seed germination through the modulation of gibberellin biosynthesis in Oryza sativa	2014	Plant J	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.	Seed germination is a key developmental process in the plant life cycle that is influenced by various environmental cues and phytohormones through gene expression and a series of metabolism pathways. In the present study, we investigated a C2C2-type finger protein, OsLOL1, which promotes gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis and affects seed germination in Oryza sativa (rice). We used OsLOL1 antisense and sense transgenic lines to explore OsLOL1 functions. Seed germination timing in antisense plants was restored to wild type when exogenous GA3 was applied. The reduced expression of the GA biosynthesis gene OsKO2 and the accumulation of ent-kaurene were observed during germination in antisense plants. Based on yeast two-hybrid and firefly luciferase complementation analyses, OsLOL1 interacted with the basic leucine zipper protein OsbZIP58. The results from electrophoretic mobility shift and dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that OsbZIP58 binds the G-box cis-element of the OsKO2 promoter and activates LUC reporter gene expression, and that interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 activates OsKO2 gene expression. In addition, OsLOL1 decreased SOD1 gene expression and accelerated programmed cell death (PCD) in the aleurone layer of rice grains. These findings demonstrate that the interaction between OsLOL1 and OsbZIP58 influences GA biosynthesis through the activation of OsKO2 via OsbZIP58, thereby stimulating aleurone PCD and seed germination.
