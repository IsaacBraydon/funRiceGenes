Rice LSD1-like (OsLOL1) gene was involved in regulation of cell death and OsLOL 2 (rice zinc-finger gene) has been reported to regulate plant growth and disease resistance in plants. Bacterial-wilt is a devastating disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum that needs to be controlled effectively. To achieve this purpose, Agrobacterium-mediated transgenic tobacco plants were generated, which hold OsLOL 2 gene in their genome encoding zinc-finger proteins. Selection of the T2 OsLOL2 transgenic lines was accomplished using molecular techniques, and later on their physiological characterization was done. Southern-blot assay of the selected transformed lines reveals that the transgene has been incorporated into the tobacco genome. On infection with R. solanacearum strains (GMI1000 and RS1000), the selected T2 transgenic tobacco lines showed enhanced resistance against bacterial-wilt when compared to control plants. Moreover, relatively less bacterial proliferation occurred in the infected stem-tissues of the transgenic lines. Owing to smaller bacterial populations, relatively fewer blockages in xylem vessels were observed during microscopy in the transgenic lines as compared to control.
