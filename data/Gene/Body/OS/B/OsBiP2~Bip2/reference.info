10.1007-s00425-012-1714-y.pdf	Expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 is highly correlated with the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	2012	Planta	Functional Transgenic Crops Research Unit, Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	Binding protein (BiP) is a chaperone protein involved in the folding of secretory proteins in the ER lumen. OsBiP1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues, whereas the expression of OsBiP4 and OsBiP5 (OsBiP4&5) is not detected in any tissue under normal conditions. However, expression of OsBiP4&5 was highly and specifically activated under ER stress conditions induced by DTT treatment, OsBiP1 knockdown, OsBiP1 overexpression, OsIRE1 overexpression, or various exogenous recombinant proteins in transgenic rice. In contrast, OsBiP4&5 did not accumulate in OsIRE1 knockdown transgenic rice even after DTT treatment. When the subcellular localization of OsBiP4&5 was investigated in seed endosperm cells under the ER stress condition, OsBiP4&5 were localized to the ER, but did not participate in ER-derived protein body (PB-I) formation in a different manner to OsBiP1. These results indicate that OsBiP4&5 levels were positively correlated with stress levels in the ER. Taken together, these results suggest that OsBiP4&5 are ER stress-related BiP proteins that are regulated by OsIRE1/OsbZIP50 pathway and that they may have a distinct function from that of OsBiP1 in rice.
Hayashi-2012-Signal transduction.pdf	Signal transduction by IRE1-mediated splicing of bZIP50 and other stress sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response of rice	2012	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8602, Japan.	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 transduces signals by inducing the unconventional splicing of mRNAs encoding key transcription factors: HAC1 in yeast and XBP1 in animals. However, no HAC1 or XBP1 homologues have been found in plants, and until recently the substrate for plant IRE1 has remained unknown. This study demonstrates that the Oryza sativa (rice) OsbZIP50 transcription factor, an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtbZIP60, is regulated by IRE1-mediated splicing of its RNA. Despite the presence of a transcriptional activation domain, OsbZIP50 protein is not translocated into the nucleus efficiently in the absence of OsbZIP50 mRNA splicing. Unconventional splicing of OsbZIP50 mRNA causes a frame shift, which results in the appearance of a nuclear localization signal in the newly translated OsbZIP50. OsbZIP50 mRNA is spliced in a similar manner to HAC1 and XBP1 mRNAs; however, this splicing has very different effects on the translation products, a finding that shows the diversity of IRE1-related transcription factors in eukaryotes. In addition, the expression of OsbZIP50 is affected by ER stress sensor proteins OsIRE1, OsbZIP39 and OsbZIP60. ER stress-related genes differ with respect to their dependency on OsbZIP50 for their expression. The findings of this study improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant ER stress response.
Hayashi-2013-Identification of a.pdf	Identification of a cis-element that mediates multiple pathways of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in rice	2013	Plant J	Genetically Modified Organism Research Center, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Kannondai 2-1-2, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8602, Japan.	The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen leads to ER stress. Intracellular signalling pathways are activated to alleviate the stress. The ER stress sensor IRE1 induces the active form of key transcription factors, such as XBP1 in mammals and bZIP50 in Oryza sativa (rice), by mediating the unconventional splicing of their mRNAs. Although the characterization of cis-elements that are recognized by these transcription factors is essential for understanding ER stress responses, such cis-elements remain unidentified in plants. Here, a cis-element named pUPRE-II was identified from promoters of bZIP50-dependent genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The sequence of pUPRE-II (e.g., 5'-GATGACGCGTAC-3' in the OsSAR1 promoter) was found to be flexible and not identical with that of mUPRE, a cis-element that preferentially interacts with mammalian XBP1. Unexpectedly, the transcription factor bZIP60, another ER stress sensor in rice, and a counterpart of mammalian ATF6, also showed strong binding affinity for pUPRE-II without assistance from co-factors. Reporter assays indicated that pUPRE-II significantly contributes to gene expression mediated by bZIP50 or bZIP60 in rice. Although both bZIP50 and bZIP60 bound to pUPRE-II, these transcription factors showed distinct requirements for transcriptional activation. This study provides a missing link between ER stress sensors and stress-responsive genes in rice. Furthermore, the characteristics of pUPRE-II highlight the uniqueness of ER stress-responsive transcription in plants.
