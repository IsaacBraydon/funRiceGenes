OsBiP3|BiP3	OsbZIP60	OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.	 Notably, the expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes, such as OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2 and OsBiP3, is up-regulated in the endosperm cells of osbzip60, and overexpression of all these UPR genes causes various degrees of chalkiness
OsBiP3|BiP3	OsbZIP60	OsbZIP60-mediated unfolded protein response regulates grain chalkiness in rice.	 Furthermore, OsbZIP60 is found to activate the expression of key genes related to grain chalkiness, such as GPA3, FSE1, FLO7, Chalk5, OsNF-YB1, and OsPK2, whose expression is significantly suppressed in osbzip60 and overexpression lines of OsbZIP50, OsBiP1, OsBiP2, and OsBiP3
