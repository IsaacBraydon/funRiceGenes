Toyota-2006-Expression profiling.pdf	Expression profiling of starch metabolism-related plastidic translocator genes in rice	2006	Planta	CREST, Japan Science and Technology Corporation, Omiya, Saitama, Japan.	The genes encoding the major putative rice plastidic translocators involved in the carbon flow related to starch metabolism were identified by exhaustive database searches. The genes identified were two for the triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), five for the glucose 6-phosphate/phosphate translocator (GPT) including putatively non-functional ones, four for the phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate translocator (PPT), three for the putative ADP-glucose translocator (or Brittle-1 protein, BT1), two for the plastidic nucleotide transport protein (NTT), and one each for the plastidic glucose translocator (pGlcT) and the maltose translocator (MT). The expression patterns of the genes in various photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic organs were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. OsBT1-1 was specifically expressed in the seed and its transcript level tremendously increased at the onset of vigorous starch production in the endosperm, suggesting that the ADP-glucose synthesized in the cytosol is a major precursor for starch biosynthesis in the endosperm amyloplast. In contrast, all of the genes for OsTPT, OsPPT, and OsNTT were mainly expressed in source tissues, suggesting that their proteins play essential roles in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in chloroplasts. Substantial expression of the four OsGPT genes and the OspGlcT gene in both source and sink organs suggests that the transport of glucose phosphate and glucose is physiologically important in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues. The present study shows that comprehensive analysis of expression patterns of the plastidic translocator genes is a valuable tool for the elucidation of the functions of the translocators in the regulation of starch metabolism in rice.
NA	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	2017	Sci Rep	State Key Laboratory of Hybrid Rice, Key Laboratory for Research and Utilization of Heterosis in Indica Rice, Ministry of Agriculture, the Yangtze River Valley Hybrid Rice Collaboration Innovation Center, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, R. P. China.	Chloroplast development is an important subject in botany. In this study, a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant exhibiting impairment in early chloroplast development (seedling leaf albino (sla)) was isolated from a filial generation via hybridization breeding. The sla mutant seedlings have an aberrant form of chloroplasts, which resulted in albinism at the first and second leaves; however, the leaf sheath was green. The mutant gradually turned green after the two-leaf stage, and the third leaf was a normal shade of green. Map-based cloning indicated that the gene OsBT1-3, which belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF), is responsible for the sla mutant phenotype. OsBT1-3 expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings. The results also showed that OsBT1-3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was targeted to the chloroplast, and a Western blot assay using a peptide-specific antibody indicated that OsBT1-3 localizes to the chloroplast envelope. We also demonstrated that OsBT1-3 functions as a unidirectional transporter of adenine nucleotides. Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage.
