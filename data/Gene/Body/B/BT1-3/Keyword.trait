OsBT1-3	leaf	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	OsBT1-3 expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings
OsBT1-3	seedlings	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	OsBT1-3 expression was high in the young leaves, decreased after the two-leaf stage, and was low in the sheath, and these findings are consistent with the recovery of a number of chloroplasts in the third leaf of sla mutant seedlings
OsBT1-3	seedling	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage
OsBT1-3	chloroplast	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	The results also showed that OsBT1-3-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was targeted to the chloroplast, and a Western blot assay using a peptide-specific antibody indicated that OsBT1-3 localizes to the chloroplast envelope
OsBT1-3	chloroplast	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage
OsBT1-3	development	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage
OsBT1-3	transporter	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	We also demonstrated that OsBT1-3 functions as a unidirectional transporter of adenine nucleotides
OsBT1-3	chloroplast development	Identification and Characterization of a Plastidic Adenine Nucleotide Uniporter (OsBT1-3) Required for Chloroplast Development in the Early Leaf Stage of Rice.	Based on these findings, OsBT1-3 likely acts as a plastid nucleotide uniporter and is essential for chloroplast development in rice leaves at the young seedling stage
