NTRA	NTRB	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR| In the present study, we describe isolation and cloning of two cDNAs encoding OsNTRA and OsNTRB| OsNTRB and OsNTRA exhibited almost similar in vitro activities| OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
