NA	Agronomic nitrogen-use efficiency of rice can be increased by driving OsNRT2.1 expression with the OsNAR2.1 promoter.	2016	Plant Biotechnol J	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Ministry of Agriculture, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, China.	The importance of the nitrate (NO3-) transporter for yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) in rice was previously demonstrated using map-based cloning. In this study, we enhanced the expression of the OsNRT2.1 gene, which encodes a high-affinity NO3- transporter, using a ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter and the NO3--inducible promoter of the OsNAR2.1 gene to drive OsNRT2.1 expression in transgenic rice plants. Transgenic lines expressing pUbi:OsNRT2.1 or pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 constructs exhibited the increased total biomass including yields of approximately 21% and 38% compared with wild-type (WT) plants. The agricultural NUE (ANUE) of the pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines decreased to 83% of that of the WT plants, while the ANUE of the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines increased to 128% of that of the WT plants. The dry matter transfer into grain decreased by 68% in the pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines and increased by 46% in the pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines relative to the WT. The expression of OsNRT2.1 in shoot and grain showed that Ubi enhanced OsNRT2.1 expression by 7.5-fold averagely and OsNAR2.1 promoters increased by about 80% higher than the WT. Interestingly, we found that the OsNAR2.1 was expressed higher in all the organs of pUbi:OsNRT2.1 lines; however, for pOsNAR2.1:OsNRT2.1 lines, OsNAR2.1 expression was only increased in root, leaf sheaths and internodes. We show that increased expression of OsNRT2.1, especially driven by OsNAR2.1 promoter, can improve the yield and NUE in rice.
NA	Overexpression of a High-Affinity Nitrate Transporter OsNRT2.1 Increases Yield and Manganese Accumulation in Rice Under Alternating Wet and Dry Condition.	2018	Front Plant Sci	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, Nanjing, China.	Nitrate and manganese (Mn) are necessary elements for the growth and development of rice in paddy soil. Under physiological conditions, we previously reported that the uptake of Mn in roots can be improved by the addition of external nitrate but not ammonium. To investigate the mechanism(s) of this phenotype, we produced plant lines overexpressing OsNRT2.1 and assessed Mn uptake under alternating wet and dry (AWD) and waterlogged (WL) conditions. Under AWD condition, we observed a 31% reduction in grain yields of wild type (WT) plants compared to WL condition. Interestingly, the overexpression of OsNRT2.1 could recover this loss, as OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines displayed higher grain yields than WT plants. We also observed 60% higher grain Mn in the transgenic lines in AWD condition and approximately 30% higher Mn in the grain of transgenic lines in WL condition. We further found that the overexpression of OsNRT2.1 did not alter Mg and Fe in the seeds in either growth condition. The reasons for the increased Mn content in OsNRT2.1 transgenic seeds in AWD condition could be explained by the elevated expression of OsNRAMP family genes including OsNRAMP3, OsNRAMP5, and OsNRAMP6 in node I, the panicle-neck, and the flag leaves. The mechanism(s) underpinning the upregulation of these genes requires further investigation. Taken together, our results provide a new function of OsNRT2.1 in improving rice yields and grain Mn accumulation during water-saving cultivation patterns. This represents a new strategy for maintaining yield and improving food quality in a sustainable agricultural system.
NA	Overexpression of Nitrate Transporter OsNRT2.1 Enhances Nitrate-Dependent Root Elongation.	2019	Genes (Basel)	State Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Germplasm Enhancement, MOA Key Laboratory of Plant Nutrition and Fertilization in Low-Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing 210095, China. raymisbah@ymail.com.	Root morphology is essential for plant survival. NO<U+2083>- is not only a nutrient, but also a signal substance affecting root growth in plants. However, the mechanism of NO<U+2083>--mediated root growth in rice remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of OsNRT2.1 on root elongation and nitrate signaling-mediated auxin transport using OsNRT2.1 overexpression lines. We observed that the overexpression of OsNRT2.1 increased the total root length in rice, including the seminal root length, total adventitious root length, and total lateral root length in seminal roots and adventitious roots under 0.5-mM NO<U+2083><U+207B> conditions, but not under 0.5-mM NH<U+2084><U+207A> conditions. Compared with wild type (WT), the 15NO<U+2083>- influx rate of OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines increased by 24.3%, and the expressions of auxin transporter genes (OsPIN1a/b/c and OsPIN2) also increased significantly under 0.5-mM NO<U+2083>- conditions. There were no significant differences in root length, <U+00DF>-glucuronidase (GUS) activity, and the expressions of OsPIN1a/b/c and OsPIN2 in the pDR5::GUS transgenic line between 0.5-mM NO<U+2083>- and 0.5-mM NH<U+2084><U+207A> treatments together with N-1-naphthylphalamic acid (NPA) treatment. When exogenous NPA was added to 0.5-mM NO<U+2083>- nutrient solution, there were no significant differences in the total root length and expressions of OsPIN1a/b/c and OsPIN2 between transgenic plants and WT, although the 15NO<U+2083>- influx rate of OsNRT2.1 transgenic lines increased by 25.2%. These results indicated that OsNRT2.1 is involved in the pathway of nitrate-dependent root elongation by regulating auxin transport to roots; i.e., overexpressing OsNRT2.1 promotes an effect on root growth upon NO<U+2083>- treatment that requires active polar auxin transport.
