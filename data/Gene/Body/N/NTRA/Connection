NTRA	NTRB	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR
NTRA	NTRB	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	In the present study, we describe isolation and cloning of two cDNAs encoding OsNTRA and OsNTRB
NTRA	NTRB	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	OsNTRB and OsNTRA exhibited almost similar in vitro activities
NTRA	NTRB	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
