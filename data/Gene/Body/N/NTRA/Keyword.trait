NTRA	chloroplast	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR
NTRA	seedling	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
NTRA	root	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
NTRA	shoot	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRB was highly expressed in roots and shoots of one, two and three week-old rice seedlings, whereas the expression of OsNTRA in shoots was much higher than roots
NTRA	mitochondria	Molecular cloning and characterization of two isoforms of cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase from rice	 OsNTRC is chloroplastic type NTR whereas OsNTRA and OsNTRB are cytoplasmic/mitochondrial type NTR
