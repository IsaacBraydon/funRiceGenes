Photoperiod-sensitive rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars are widely grown in rainfed lowland areas with unfavorable water regimes. A molecular marker for the trait would be useful in genetic and physiological studies and in developing improved photoperiod-sensitive cultivars. Previous genetic studies identified a major gene for photoperiod sensitivity on chromosome 6. We have tested an isozyme marker and several RFLP probes mapping to chromosome 6 in an attempt to identify marker(s) tightly linked to photoperiod sensitivity in tropical rice cultivars. We report here that the isozyme gene Pgi-2 is linked (23.2+/-4.7 cM) to the photoperiod-sensitivity gene in the cultivar GEB-24. Although association of duration with Pgi-2 alleles can be used to detect segregation of the photoperiod sensitivity gene in crosses, it will probably not be useful as a marker in selection because of its loose linkage. In contrast, a gene for photoperiod sensitivity in the cultivar Puang Rai 2 was found to be closely linked to the rice genomic clone RG64. Among 15 F3 lines homozygous for photoperiod insensitivity, no recombinants were detected with RG64. This clone is thus an excellent probe to follow segregation of the major photoperiod-sensitivity gene in rice crosses.
