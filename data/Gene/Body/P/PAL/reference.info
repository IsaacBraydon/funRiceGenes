Gomez-Ariza-2007-Sucrose-mediated pri.pdf	Sucrose-mediated priming of plant defense responses and broad-spectrum disease resistance by overexpression of the maize pathogenesis-related PRms protein in rice plants	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Departamento de Genetica Molecular, Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Vegetal, Consorcio CSIC-IRTA, Jordi Girona 18, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.	Expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes is part of the plant's natural defense response against pathogen attack. The PRms gene encodes a fungal-inducible PR protein from maize. Here, we demonstrate that expression of PRms in transgenic rice confers broad-spectrum protection against pathogens, including fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae, Fusarium verticillioides, and Helminthosporium oryzae) and bacterial (Erwinia chrysanthemi) pathogens. The PRms-mediated disease resistance in rice plants is associated with an enhanced capacity to express and activate the natural plant defense mechanisms. Thus, PRms rice plants display a basal level of expression of endogenous defense genes in the absence of the pathogen. PRms plants also exhibit stronger and quicker defense responses during pathogen infection. We also have found that sucrose accumulates at higher levels in leaves of PRms plants. Sucrose responsiveness of rice defense genes correlates with the pathogen-responsive priming of their expression in PRms rice plants. Moreover, pretreatment of rice plants with sucrose enhances resistance to M. oryzae infection. Together, these results support a sucrose-mediated priming of defense responses in PRms rice plants which results in broad-spectrum disease resistance.
NA	Salicylic acid application alleviates cadmium accumulation in brown rice by modulating its shoot to grain translocation in rice	2021	Chemosphere	Key Laboratory of Marine Food Quality and Hazard Controlling Technology of Zhejiang Province, College of Life Sciences, China Jiliang University, Hangzhou, 310018, China. Electronic address: wfj0311@cjlu.edu.cn.	Cadmium (Cd) contamination, which poses a serious threat to human health, has been recognized as a major threat to the agricultural system and crop production. Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule that plays an important role in against Cd toxicity. Previously, we found that spraying rice with SA could reduce the Cd accumulation in rice grains grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, we studied the specific mechanism of SA spray on reducing Cd accumulation in rice grain. The results showed that treatment with SA could alleviate Cd toxicity in rice by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation, but not by changing the pH, or total or available Cd of the soil. The key factor by which SA treatment reduced Cd accumulation in rice grains was by decreasing the Cd content in rice leaves at the flowering stage. This indicated that SA could modulate the Cd accumulation in shoots, reducing the Cd translocation to rice grains. Furthermore, SA could increase the H2O2 content, activating the SA-signaling pathway and modulating the expression levels of Cd transporters (OsLCT1 and OsLCD) in rice leaves to increase Cd tolerance and reduce Cd accumulation in the rice grain. Thus, spraying rice with SA may be effective measure to cope with Cd contamination in paddy soils.
NA	Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth	2020	J Sci Food Agric	Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Microbes and Functional Genomics, Jiangsu Engineering and Technology Research Center for Industrialization of Microbial Resources, College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, China.	Background: Rice spikelet rot disease (RSRD) is an emerging disease that significantly reduces rice yield and quality. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of the broad-spectrum endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 as a biocontrol agent against RSRD. We also compared the control effects of different treatments, including chemical fungicides and treatment with multiple strains and single strains in combination or individually, against RSRD. The objective of this study was to find an effective and environmentally friendly control strategy to reduce the occurrence of RSRD and improve the rice yield.  Results: In pot experiments, the effect of B3 alone was better than that of fungicide or combined measures. The results showed that root colonization by B3 significantly reduced the incidence and disease index of RSRD by 41.0% and 53.8%, respectively. This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice. Moreover, B3 improved the diversity of the bacterial community rather than the fungal community in the rice rhizosphere. It also led to a decrease in Fusarium proliferatum colonization and fumonisin content in the grain. Finally, root development was markedly promoted after B3 inoculation, and the yield improved by 48.60%. The result of field experiments showed that the incidence of RSRD and the fumonisin content were observably reduced in rice receiving B3, by 24.41% and 37.87%, respectively.  Conclusion: The endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 may become an effective tool to relieve rice spikelet rot disease. 
NA	Radial transport difference mediated by root endodermal barriers contributes to differential cadmium accumulation between japonica and indica subspecies of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	2021	J Hazard Mater	College of Resources, Sichuan Agricultural University, Chengdu 611130, China. Electronic address: taoqvip@163.com.	Although Cd concentration of grains is generally lower in japonica than in indica subspecies, the effects of root endodermal barriers on the subspecific differences in Cd accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa L.) are poorly understood. Here, we characterized the differences in endodermal differentiation between japonica and indica subspecies and their effects on Cd radial transport. Casparian strips (CSs) and suberin lamellae (SL) in japonica subspecies were initiated at the 6%- 7% and 21%- 27% position from the root tip, respectively, which were 65% and 26% earlier than in indica subspecies, respectively. The lignin/suberin content in japonica subspecies was 47%/42% greater than that in indica subspecies because of the higher expression of lignin/suberin biosynthesis-related genes (OsCASP1, OsPAL, OsCYP86A1 and OsKCS20). Cd exposure induced endodermal plasticity in both subspecies, but the changes in japonica were greater than in indica subspecies. The earlier formation of CSs/SL in japonica subspecies significantly restricted the flow of radial transport tracer to reach the xylem and decreased Cd influx into roots, that is, endodermal barriers inhibited Cd radial transport via both apoplastic and cell-to-cell pathways, thus decreasing the root-to-shoot transport of Cd in japonica subspecies. Our findings are beneficial for the genetic modification of rice with low-Cd-accumulating ability.
