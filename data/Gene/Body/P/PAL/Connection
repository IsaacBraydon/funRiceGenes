OsPAL	PAL|OsPAL4	Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.	OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
JIOsPR10|OsPR10	OsPAL	Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 induces rice resistance to RSRD caused by Fusarium proliferatum and promotes plant growth	 This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice
OsCASP1	OsPAL	Radial transport difference mediated by root endodermal barriers contributes to differential cadmium accumulation between japonica and indica subspecies of rice (Oryza sativa L.).	 The lignin/suberin content in japonica subspecies was 47%/42% greater than that in indica subspecies because of the higher expression of lignin/suberin biosynthesis-related genes (OsCASP1, OsPAL, OsCYP86A1 and OsKCS20)
