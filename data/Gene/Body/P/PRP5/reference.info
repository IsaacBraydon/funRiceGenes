Macovei-2012-microRNAs targeting.pdf	microRNAs targeting DEAD-box helicases are involved in salinity stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2012	BMC Plant Biol	Plant Molecular Biology Group, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Aruna Asaf Ali Marg, New Delhi, 110067, India.	BACKGROUND: Rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important food crop in the world, is considered to be a salt-sensitive crop. Excess levels of salt adversely affect all the major metabolic activities, including cell wall damage, cytoplasmic lysis and genomic stability. In order to cope with salt stress, plants have evolved high degrees of developmental plasticity, including adaptation via cascades of molecular networks and changes in gene expression profiles. Posttranscriptional regulation, through the activity of microRNAs, also plays an important role in the plant response to salinity conditions. MicroRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that modulate gene expression and are involved in the most essential physiological processes, including plant development and adaptation to environmental changes. RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR408 and osa-MIR164e along with their targeted genes, under salinity stress conditions in wild type and transgenic rice plants ectopically expressing the PDH45 (Pea DNA Helicase) gene. The present miRNAs were predicted to target the OsABP (ATP-Binding Protein), OsDSHCT (DOB1/SK12/helY-like DEAD-box Helicase) and OsDBH (DEAD-Box Helicase) genes, included in the DEAD-box helicase family. An in silico characterization of the proteins was performed and the miRNAs predicted targets were validated by RLM-5'RACE. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes were up-regulated in response to 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments. The present study also highlighted an increased accumulation of the gene transcripts in wild type plants, with the exception of the OsABP mRNA which showed the highest level (15.1-fold change compared to control) in the transgenic plants treated with 200 mM NaCl. Salinity treatments also affected the expression of osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408, found to be significantly down-regulated, although the changes in miRNA expression were limited. CONCLUSIONS: Osa-MIR414, osa-MIR164e and osa-MIR408 were experimentally validated for the first time in plants as targeting the OsABP, OsDBH and OsDSHCT genes. Our data showed that that the genes were up-regulated and the miRNAs were down-regulated in relation to salt stress. The negative correlation between the miRNAs and their targets was proven.
NA	DEAD-box RNA helicase 42 plays a critical role in pre-mRNA splicing under cold stress.	2019	Plant Physiol	National Central University CITY: Taoyuan POSTAL_CODE: 320 Taiwan chungan@cc.ncu.edu.tw.	Low temperature is an important environmental stress that adversely affects rice (Oryza sativa) growth and productivity. Splicing of pre-mRNA is a crucial post-transcriptional regulatory step in gene expression in plants, and is sensitive to temperature. DEAD-box RNA helicases belong to a RNA helicase family involved in the rearrangement of ribonucleoprotein complexes and the modification of RNA structure, and are therefore involved in all aspects of RNA metabolism. In this study, we demonstrate that the rate of pre-mRNA splicing is reduced in rice at low temperatures, and the DEAD-box RNA helicase 42 (OsRH42) is necessary to support effective splicing of pre-mRNA during mRNA maturation at low temperatures. OsRH42 expression is tightly coupled to temperature fluctuation, and OsRH42 is localized in the splicing speckles and interacts directly with U2 snRNA. Retarded pre-mRNA splicing and plant growth defects were exhibited by OsRH42-knockdown transgenic lines at low temperatures, thus indicating that OsRH42 performs an essential role in ensuring accurate pre-mRNA splicing and normal plant growth under low ambient temperature. Unexpectedly, our results show that OsRH42 overexpression significantly disrupts the pre-mRNA splicing pathway, causing retarded plant growth and reducing plant cold tolerance. Combined, these results indicate that accurate control of OsRH42 homeostasis is essential for rice plants to respond to changes in ambient temperature. In addition, our study presents the molecular mechanism of DEAD-box RNA helicase function in pre-mRNA splicing, which is required for adaptation to cold stress in rice.
