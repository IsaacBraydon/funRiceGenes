PRP5|OsRH42	 OsRH42 expression is tightly coupled to temperature fluctuation, and OsRH42 is localized in the splicing speckles and interacts directly with U2 snRNA |  Unexpectedly, our results show that OsRH42 overexpression significantly disrupts the pre-mRNA splicing pathway, causing retarded plant growth and reducing plant cold tolerance	 Unexpectedly, our results show that OsRH42 overexpression significantly disrupts the pre-mRNA splicing pathway, causing retarded plant growth and reducing plant cold tolerance
