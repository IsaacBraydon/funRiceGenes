Chittoor-1997-Differential inducti.pdf	Differential induction of a peroxidase gene family during infection of rice by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae	1997	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Department of Plant Pathology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506, USA.	Induction of peroxidase has been correlated with resistant interactions between rice and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. To assist in analysis of the role of rice peroxidases in plant defense against the bacterial pathogen, three peroxidase genes, POX22.3, POX8.1, and POX5.1, were identified from a rice cDNA library that was constructed from leaves of plants undergoing a resistant reaction. These genes were highly similar in nucleic acid and amino acid sequences and belonged to a gene family. The three genes showed differential expression in infiltrated rice leaves during pathogen interactions and mechanical stress. Only two peroxidase genes, POX8.1 and POX22.3, were predominantly expressed during resistant interactions. These two genes also were expressed during susceptible interactions, but induction was delayed compared with resistant interactions. POXgX9, a fourth peroxidase gene that was isolated from a genomic library, is adjacent to POX22.3 in the rice genome and has greater than 90% similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity to POX22.3. Interestingly, POXgX9 was expressed only in the roots of rice plants. While POX22.3 was expressed in both leaves and roots, POX8.1 and POX5.1 were not detected in roots but were induced in leaves by mechanical wounding at different times after treatment. POX22.3, POX8.1, and POX5.1 were estimated to be present in single copies in rice haploid genome. These results indicate that different members of the rice peroxidase gene family are distinctly regulated in response to various environmental cues.
Passardi-2004-The class III peroxi.pdf	The class III peroxidase multigenic family in rice and its evolution in land plants	2004	Phytochemistry	Laboratory of Plant Physiology, University of Geneva, Quai Ernest-Ansermet 30, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.	Plant peroxidases (class III peroxidases, E.C. 1.11.1.7) are secreted glycoproteins known to be involved in the mechanism of cell elongation, in cell wall construction and differentiation, and in the defense against pathogens. They usually form large multigenic families in angiosperms. The recent completion of rice (Oryza sativa japonica c.v. Nipponbare) genome sequencing allowed drawing up the full inventory of the genes encoding class III peroxidases in this plant. We found 138 peroxidase genes distributed among the 12 rice chromosomes. In contrast to several other gene families studied so far, peroxidase genes are twice as numerous in rice as in Arabidopsis. This large number of genes results from various duplication events that were tentatively traced back using a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of conserved amino acid sequences. We also searched for peroxidase encoding genes in the major phyla of plant kingdom. In addition to gymnosperms and angiosperms, sequences were found in liverworts, mosses and ferns, but not in unicellular green algae. Two rice and one Arabidopsis peroxidase genes appeared to be rather close to the only known sequence from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The possible relationship of these peroxidases with the putative ancestor of peroxidase genes is discussed, as well as the connection between the development of the class III peroxidase multigenic family and the emergence of the first land plants.
