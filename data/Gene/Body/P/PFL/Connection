PFL	Roc5|oul1	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	Gene expression profiling, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and RNA interference (RNAi) analyses revealed that Protodermal Factor Like (PFL) was probably down-regulated in oul1
PFL	Roc5|oul1	Leaf rolling controlled by the homeodomain leucine zipper class IV gene Roc5 in rice	The mRNA level of PFL was increased in Roc5-overexpressing lines, and PFL-RNAi transgenic plants exhibit reversely rolling leaves by reason of increases of bulliform cell number and size, indicating that Roc5 may have a conserved function
