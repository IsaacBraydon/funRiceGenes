PAD4|OsPAD4	bacteria blight disease	Rice OsPAD4 functions differently from Arabidopsis AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions	Suppression of OsPAD4 by RNA interference (RNAi) increased rice susceptibility to the biotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), which causes bacteria blight disease in local tissue.

PAD4|OsPAD4	JA	Rice OsPAD4 functions differently from Arabidopsis AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions	The increased susceptibility to Xoo was associated with reduced accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) and phytoalexin momilactone A (MOA).

PAD4|OsPAD4	jasmonic acid	Rice OsPAD4 functions differently from Arabidopsis AtPAD4 in host-pathogen interactions	Exogenous application of JA complemented the phenotype of OsPAD4-RNAi plants in response to Xoo
