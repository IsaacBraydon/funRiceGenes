The amplified product was cloned into vector extracted with 80% methanol and quantified by GC­MS             349 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of Os11g0148500, Characterization of the ospk1 mutant                            single copy of the Os11g0148500 gene. We named the that a T-DNA insertion into the transcriptional regulatory             also found that the mRNA level of Os12g0145700, which The OsPK1 protein was predicted to be cytoplasmic by                   Os11g0148500 and introduced the amplified fragment into vascular bundles (Fig. 5i, j). In the root, GUS expression        alignment of OsPK1 with Os12g0145700, umc2053, homologies (Fig. 6a). Moreover, sequence searches in                  of Os01g0866400, which encodes a putative fructose-1, (Os09g0535000) was significantly increased in ospk1. TIM              nine transaminase (ALT) were examined by RT-PCR phate. Expression of Os06g0256500, which encodes a                    chloroplastic NADP-dependent ME. Os01g0208700, increased in ospk1. Expression of Os04g0119400, which                 ospk1. The transcription levels of several isoforms of PK in CoA. This reaction is not part of glycolysis, but is the route        although a slightly increased level of Os07g0181000 and a of entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in most              slightly decreased level of Os10g0571200 were observed in Os12g0145700. Transcription white letter with gray background (80%); black letter with gray         seedlings. TIM, Os09g0535000, noted as triosephosphate isomerase; background (60%). b Enzymatic activity was determined spectro-          PDH, Os04g0119400, noted as pyruvate dehydrogenase; GPI, photometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm         Os06g0256500, noted as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; FBPase, (A340 value at 5 min subtracted from that at 0 min). OsPK1, expressed   Os01g0866400, noted as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase third leaf blade of 10-day-old seedlings was used for the analysis.   Os10g0204400, noted as PEP carboxykinase; PEPC, PEP carboxyl- a Pyruvate and PEP contents in WT and ospk1. Two biological           ase; PEPC-1, Os02g0244700; PEPC-2, Os01g0208700; ALT, alanine replications were performed in each experiment. Values are            transaminase; ALT-1, Os10g0390500; ALT-2, Os07g0108300. c RT- of genes related to pyruvate/PEP metabolism. ME6, Os01g0188400,       Actin1 gene was used as a reference of RNA concentration with the companion cells. Thus, OsPK1 appears to be                   sequence alignment results suggested that Os12g0145700 Expression of Os09g0535000, which is similar to the              castor leaves is a heterotetramer consisting of two subunits Os04g0119400, which encodes a putative PDH, was                  Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 30571003) and the Os01g0208700, encoding a putative PEPC, was expressed
