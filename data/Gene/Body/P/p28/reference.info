Wheat has been shown to have two forms of the cap-binding protein that participate in the initiation of translation. To identify cap-binding proteins from other higher plant species, the expressed sequence tag (EST) database was searched. Several rice ESTs were identified with similarity to both forms of the wheat cap-binding proteins. Two of the rice ESTs were obtained and the cDNA sequences completed. The deduced amino acid sequences of the rice cap-binding proteins are compared to the wheat cap-binding proteins and cap-binding proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis and human.
