Trehalose plays an important role in metabolic regulation and abiotic stress tolerance in a variety of organisms. In plants, its biosynthesis is catalyzed by two key enzymes: trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). The genome of rice (Oryza sativa) contains 11 OsTPS genes, and only OsTPS1 shows TPS activity. To demonstrate the physiological function of OsTPS1, we introduced it into rice and found that OsTPS1 overexpression improved the tolerance of rice seedling to cold, high salinity and drought treatments without other significant phenotypic changes. In transgenic lines overexpressing OsTPS1, trehalose and proline concentrations were higher than in the wild type and some stress-related genes were up-regulated, including WSI18, RAB16C, HSP70, and ELIP. These results demonstrate that OsTPS1 may enhance the abiotic stress tolerance of plants by increasing the amount of trehalose and proline, and regulating the expression of stress-related genes. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of some Class II TPSs also enhanced plant tolerance of abiotic stress. This work will help to clarify the role of trehalose metabolism in abiotic stress response in higher plants.
NA	Identification and Characterization of ABA-Responsive MicroRNAs in Rice.	2015	J Genet Genomics	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China.	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that silence genes through mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is essential for plant development and adaptation to abiotic and biotic stresses. In Arabidopsis, miRNAs are implicated in ABA functions. However, ABA-responsive miRNAs have not been systematically studied in rice. Here high throughput sequencing of small RNAs revealed that 107 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the rice ABA deficient mutant, Osaba1. Of these, 13 were confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Among them, miR1425-5P, miR169a, miR169n, miR390-5P, miR397a and miR397b were up-regulated, but miR162b reduced in expression in Osaba1. The targets of these 13 miRNAs were predicted and validated by gene expression profiling. Interestingly, the expression levels of these miRNAs and their targets were regulated by ABA. Cleavage sites were detected on 7 of the miRNA targets by 5'-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'-RACE). Finally, miR162b and its target OsTRE1 were shown to affect rice resistance to drought stress, suggesting that miR162b increases resistance to drought by targeting OsTRE1. Our work provides important information for further characterization and functional analysis of ABA-responsive miRNAs in rice.
NA	Functional identification of a rice trehalase gene involved in salt stress tolerance.	2018	Gene	Hokkaido Agricultural Research Center, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, Hitsujigaoka, Sapporo 062-8555, Japan.	Trehalose is a disaccharide with a pivotal role in plant growth and development. In contrast to the recent advances in understanding trehalose biosynthesis in plants, their catabolism of trehalose is poorly understood. Here, we isolated and characterized a trehalase gene, OsTRE1, in rice (Oryza sativa L.). An expression analysis in young seedlings revealed that OsTRE1 is induced by stresses such as salt, drought, and chilling. ABA treatment also transiently upregulated OsTRE1 expression. The accumulation of OsTRE1 mRNA in response to 150<U+202F>mM NaCl was consistent with an increased trehalase activity in the roots. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTRE1 showed remarkable increases in trehalase activity and dramatic decreases in trehalose abundance compared with the wild type, with little change in the levels of other soluble sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Callus cells generated from the transgenic lines overexpressing OsTRE1 were able to grow using trehalose as their sole carbon source. These data indicated that OsTRE1 is a functional trehalase gene in rice. The OsTRE1 overexpressors did not have notable morphological alterations or growth defects but exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting the involvement of OsTRE1 in salt stress tolerance in rice.
