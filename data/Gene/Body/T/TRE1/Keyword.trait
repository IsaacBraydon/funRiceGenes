OsTRE1	seedlings	Functional identification of a rice trehalase gene involved in salt stress tolerance.	 An expression analysis in young seedlings revealed that OsTRE1 is induced by stresses such as salt, drought, and chilling
OsTRE1	growth	Functional identification of a rice trehalase gene involved in salt stress tolerance.	 The OsTRE1 overexpressors did not have notable morphological alterations or growth defects but exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting the involvement of OsTRE1 in salt stress tolerance in rice
OsTRE1	salt	Functional identification of a rice trehalase gene involved in salt stress tolerance.	 The OsTRE1 overexpressors did not have notable morphological alterations or growth defects but exhibited enhanced salt tolerance, suggesting the involvement of OsTRE1 in salt stress tolerance in rice

OsTRE1	sucrose	Functional identification of a rice trehalase gene involved in salt stress tolerance.	 Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTRE1 showed remarkable increases in trehalase activity and dramatic decreases in trehalose abundance compared with the wild type, with little change in the levels of other soluble sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose
