YDA1|SMG2|OsMKKK10	stomatal density	RNAi-directed downregulation of vacuolar H(+) -ATPase subunit a results in enhanced stomatal aperture and density in rice	Moreover, YDA1, encoding a member of MAPKs involved in the regulation of stomatal development [9], was also significantly down-regulated in all three OsVHA-A-RNAi lines (Figure 10D), suggesting that OsVHA might control the stomatal density via regulating YDA1 expression.
