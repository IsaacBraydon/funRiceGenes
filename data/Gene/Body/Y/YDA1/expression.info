YDA1|SMG2|OsMKKK10	 Loss of OsMKKK10 function results in small and light grains, short panicles and semi-dwarf plants, while overexpression of constitutively active OsMKKK10 (CA-OsMKKK10) causes large and heavy grains, long panicles and tall plants in rice	 Loss of OsMKKK10 function results in small and light grains, short panicles and semi-dwarf plants, while overexpression of constitutively active OsMKKK10 (CA-OsMKKK10) causes large and heavy grains, long panicles and tall plants in rice
YDA1|SMG2|OsMKKK10	 Furthermore, overexpression of either DST or OsCKX2 rescued the spikelet number phenotype of the oser1, osmkkk10, osmkk4, and osmpk6 mutants, suggesting that the DST-OsCKX2 module genetically functions downstream of the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway	 Furthermore, overexpression of either DST or OsCKX2 rescued the spikelet number phenotype of the oser1, osmkkk10, osmkk4, and osmpk6 mutants, suggesting that the DST-OsCKX2 module genetically functions downstream of the OsER1-OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMPK6 pathway
