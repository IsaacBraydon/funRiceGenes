OsMKK4|LARGE11	YDA1|SMG2|OsMKKK10	Control of grain size and weight by the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway in rice.	 OsMKKK10 interacts with and phosphorylates OsMKK4
OsMKK4|LARGE11	YDA1|SMG2|OsMKKK10	Control of grain size and weight by the OsMKKK10-OsMKK4-OsMAPK6 signaling pathway in rice.	 Further biochemical and genetic analyses reveal that OsMKKK10, OsMKK4 and OsMAPK6 function in a common pathway to control grain size
