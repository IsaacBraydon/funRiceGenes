Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed that the starch granules in these mutants are smaller and rounder compared with the wild type controls, and that the mutant endosperm is characterized by a loosely packed central portion exhibiting a floury-like phenotype. Hence, the OsSSIIIa (Oryza sativa SSIIIa) mutations are referred to as white-core floury endosperm 5-1 (flo5-1) and flo5-2. Based upon their X-ray diffraction patterns, the crystallinity of the starch in the flo5 mutant endosperm is decreased compared with wild type. Through determination of the chain-length distribution of the mutant endosperm starch, we found that flo5-1 and flo5-2 mutants have reduced the content of long chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 30 or greater compared with the controls. This suggests that OsSSIIIa/Flo5 plays an important role in generating relatively long chains in rice endosperm. In addition, DP 6 to 8 and DP 16 to 20 appeared to be reduced in endosperm starch of flo5-1 and flo5-2, whereas DP 9 to 15 and DP 22 to 29 were increased in these mutants. By the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the gelatinization temperatures of endosperm starch were found to be 1-5 degrees C lower than those of the control. We propose a distinct role for OsSSIIIa/Flo5 and the coordinated action of other SS isoforms during starch synthesis in the seed endosperm of rice.
Li-2011-Genetic diversity an.pdf	Genetic diversity and domestication history of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) as inferred from multiple gene sequences	2011	Theor Appl Genet	State Key Laboratory of Systematic and Evolutionary Botany, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiangshan, Beijing, 100093, China.	Nucleotide variation in 14 unlinked nuclear genes was investigated in species-wide samples of African rice (Oryza glaberrima) and its wild progenitor (O. barthii). Average estimates of nucleotide diversity were extremely low in both species (theta (sil) = 0.0007 for O. glaberrima; theta (sil) = 0.0024 for O. barthii). About 70% less diversity was found in O. glaberrima than in its progenitor O. barthii. Coalescent simulation indicated that such dramatic reduction of nucleotide diversity in African rice could be explained mainly by a severe bottleneck during its domestication. The progenitor of African rice maintained also low genetic diversity, which may be attributed to small effective population size in O. barthii. Self-pollinating would be another factor leading to the unusually low diversity in both species. Genealogical analyses showed that all O. glaberrima accessions formed a strongly supported cluster with seven O. barthii individuals that were sampled exclusively from the proposed domestication centers of African rice. Population structure and principal component analyses found that the O. glaberrima group was homogeneous with no obvious genetic subdivision, in contrast to the heterogeneous O. barthii cluster. These findings support a single domestication origin of African rice in areas of the Upper Niger and Sahelian Rivers.
PNAS-2009-Tian-21760-5.pdf	Allelic diversities in rice starch biosynthesis lead to a diverse array of rice eating and cooking qualities	2009	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	State Key Laboratory of Plant Genomics and National Center for Plant Gene Research, Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.	More than half of the world's population uses rice as a source of carbon intake every day. Improving grain quality is thus essential to rice consumers. The three main properties that determine rice eating and cooking quality--amylose content, gel consistency, and gelatinization temperature--correlate with one another, but the underlying mechanism of these properties remains unclear. Through an association analysis approach, we found that genes related to starch synthesis cooperate with each other to form a fine regulating network that controls the eating and cooking quality and defines the correlation among these three properties. Genetic transformation results verified the association findings and also suggested the possibility of developing elite cultivars through modification with selected major and/or minor starch synthesis-related genes.
Yan-2011-Genetic analysis of.pdf	Genetic analysis of starch paste viscosity parameters in glutinous rice (Oryza sativa L.)	2011	Theor Appl Genet	Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Crop Genetics and Physiology, Key Laboratory of Plant Functional Genomics, Ministry of Education of China, Agricultural College of Yangzhou University, 12 East Wenhui Road, Jiangsu, 225009, People's Republic of China.	Starch paste viscosity plays an important role in estimating the cooking, eating, and processing quality of rice. The inheritance of starch paste viscosity in glutinous rice remains undefined. In the present study, 118 glutinous rice accessions were collected, and the genotypes of 17 starch synthesis-related genes (SSRG) were analyzed by using 43 gene-specific molecular markers. Association analysis indicated that 10 of 17 SSRGs were involved in controlling the rapid visco analyzer (RVA) profile parameters. Among these, the PUL gene was identified to play an important role in control of peak viscosity (PKV), hot paste viscosity (HPV), cool paste viscosity (CPV), breakdown viscosity (BDV), peak time (PeT), and paste temperature (PaT) in glutinous rice. Other SSRGs involved only a few RVA profile parameters. Furthermore, interactions between SSRGs were found being responsible for PeT, PaT, and BDV. Some of the RVA parameters, including PKV, HPV, CPV, CSV, and PaT, were mainly governed by single SSRG, whereas other parameters, such as BDV, SBV, and PeT, were controlled by a few SSRGs, functioning cooperatively. Further, three near-isogenic lines (NIL) of a japonica glutinous cv. Suyunuo as genetic background, with PUL, SSIII-1, and SSIII-2 alleles replaced with those of indica cv. Guichao 2, were employed to verify the genetic effects of the various genes, and the results were consistent with those obtained from the association analysis. These findings indicated that starch paste viscosity in glutinous rice had a complex genetic system, and the PUL gene played an important role in determining the RVA profile parameters in glutinous rice. These results provide important information for potentially improving the quality of glutinous rice.
