Rf3 on chromosome 1 and Rf4 on chromosome 10. With the availability of the rice genome sequence, an attempt was made to fine map, develop candidate gene based markers for Rf3 and Rf4 and validate the developed marker system in a set of known restorer lines. Using polymorphic markers developed from microsatellite markers and candidate gene based markers from Rf3 and Rf4 loci, local linkage maps were constructed in two mapping populations of ~1,500 F2 progeny from KRH2 (IR58025A/KMR3R) and DRRH2 (IR68897A/DR714-1-2R) hybrids. QTLs and their interactions for fertility restoration in Rf3 and Rf4 loci were identified. The identified QTL in both mapping populations together explained 66â€<U+393C><U+3E33>72 % of the phenotypic variance of the trait suggesting their utility in developing a marker system for identification of fertility restorers for WA-CMS. Sequence comparison of the two candidate genes from the Rf3 and Rf4 regions in male sterile (A) and restorer (R) lines showed 2â€<U+393C><U+3E33>3 bp indels and a few substitutions in the Rf3 region and indels of 327 and 106 bp in the Rf4 region respectively. The marker system identified in the present study was validated in 212 restorers and 34 maintainers along with earlier reported markers for fertility restoration of WA-CMS. Together DRCG-RF4-14 and DRCG-RF4-8 for the Rf4 locus and DRRM-RF3-5/DRRM-RF3-10 for the Rf3 locus showed a maximum efficiency of 92 % for identification of restorers.
