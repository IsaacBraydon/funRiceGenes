OsCERK1	SYMRK|OsSYMRK	OsSYMRK Plays an Essential Role in AM Symbiosis in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 AM colonization was mostly abolished in Ossymrk with a more severe phenotype than Oscerk1
OsCERK1	SYMRK|OsSYMRK	OsSYMRK Plays an Essential Role in AM Symbiosis in Rice (Oryza sativa).	 Bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies demonstrating an interaction between OsSYMRK and OsCERK1 indicate that OsSYMRK may play an important role in switching from immunity to symbiosis through the interaction with OsCERK1 in rice
