Gutjahr-2008-Arbuscular mycorrhiz.pdf	Arbuscular mycorrhiza-specific signaling in rice transcends the common symbiosis signaling pathway	2008	Plant Cell	Department of Plant Molecular Biology, University of Lausane, 1015 Lausane, Switzerland.	Knowledge about signaling in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses is currently restricted to the common symbiosis (SYM) signaling pathway discovered in legumes. This pathway includes calcium as a second messenger and regulates both AM and rhizobial symbioses. Both monocotyledons and dicotyledons form symbiotic associations with AM fungi, and although they differ markedly in the organization of their root systems, the morphology of colonization is similar. To identify and dissect AM-specific signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), we developed molecular phenotyping tools based on gene expression patterns that monitor various steps of AM colonization. These tools were used to distinguish common SYM-dependent and -independent signaling by examining rice mutants of selected putative legume signaling orthologs predicted to be perturbed both upstream (CASTOR and POLLUX) and downstream (CCAMK and CYCLOPS) of the central, calcium-spiking signal. All four mutants displayed impaired AM interactions and altered AM-specific gene expression patterns, therefore demonstrating functional conservation of SYM signaling between distant plant species. In addition, differential gene expression patterns in the mutants provided evidence for AM-specific but SYM-independent signaling in rice and furthermore for unexpected deviations from the SYM pathway downstream of calcium spiking.
NA	OsSYMRK Plays an Essential Role in AM Symbiosis in Rice (Oryza sativa).	2022	Plant Cell Physiol	Department of Life Sciences, School of Agriculture, Meiji University, 1-1-1, Higashimita, Tama-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, 214-8571 Japan.	Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi establish mutualistic symbiosis with a wide range of terrestrial plants, including rice. However, the mechanisms underlying the initiation of AM symbiosis are yet to be elucidated, particularly in nonleguminous plants. We previously demonstrated that chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (OsCERK1), a lysin motif receptor-like kinase essential for chitin-triggered immunity, also plays a key role in AM symbiosis in rice. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of switching between immunity and symbiosis by OsCERK1 are yet to be fully elucidated. SYMBIOSIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SYMRK)/DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS 2 (DMI2) is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase associated with both root nodule symbiosis and AM symbiosis in legumes. The homolog of SYMRK in rice, OsSYMRK, has a shorter form than that in legumes because OsSYMRK lacks a malectin-like domain (MLD). The MLD reportedly contributes to symbiosis in Lotus japonicus; however, the contribution of OsSYMRK to AM symbiosis in rice remains unclear. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the MLD of SYMRK/DMI2 is widely conserved even in mosses and ferns but absent in commelinids, including rice. To understand the function of OsSYMRK, we produced an Ossymrk knockout mutant using genome editing technology. AM colonization was mostly abolished in Ossymrk with a more severe phenotype than Oscerk1. Ca2+ spiking against chitin tetramer was also diminished in Ossymrk. In contrast, comparable defense responses against chitin heptamer to the wild type were observed in Ossymrk. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies demonstrating an interaction between OsSYMRK and OsCERK1 indicate that OsSYMRK may play an important role in switching from immunity to symbiosis through the interaction with OsCERK1 in rice.
