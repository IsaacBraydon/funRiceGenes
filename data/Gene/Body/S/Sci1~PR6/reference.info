Gomez-Ariza-2007-Sucrose-mediated pri.pdf	Sucrose-mediated priming of plant defense responses and broad-spectrum disease resistance by overexpression of the maize pathogenesis-related PRms protein in rice plants	2007	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Departamento de Genetica Molecular, Laboratorio de Genetica Molecular Vegetal, Consorcio CSIC-IRTA, Jordi Girona 18, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.	Expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes is part of the plant's natural defense response against pathogen attack. The PRms gene encodes a fungal-inducible PR protein from maize. Here, we demonstrate that expression of PRms in transgenic rice confers broad-spectrum protection against pathogens, including fungal (Magnaporthe oryzae, Fusarium verticillioides, and Helminthosporium oryzae) and bacterial (Erwinia chrysanthemi) pathogens. The PRms-mediated disease resistance in rice plants is associated with an enhanced capacity to express and activate the natural plant defense mechanisms. Thus, PRms rice plants display a basal level of expression of endogenous defense genes in the absence of the pathogen. PRms plants also exhibit stronger and quicker defense responses during pathogen infection. We also have found that sucrose accumulates at higher levels in leaves of PRms plants. Sucrose responsiveness of rice defense genes correlates with the pathogen-responsive priming of their expression in PRms rice plants. Moreover, pretreatment of rice plants with sucrose enhances resistance to M. oryzae infection. Together, these results support a sucrose-mediated priming of defense responses in PRms rice plants which results in broad-spectrum disease resistance.
NA	MG1 interacts with a protease inhibitor and confers resistance to rice root-knot nematode.	2023	Nat Commun	State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, College of Plant Science and Technology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, China.	The rice root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne graminicola) is one of the most destructive pests threatening rice (Oryza sativa L.) production in Asia; however, no rice resistance genes have been cloned. Here, we demonstrate that M. GRAMINICOLA-RESISTANCE GENE 1 (MG1), an R gene highly expressed at the site of nematode invasion, determines resistance against the nematode in several rice varieties. Introgressing MG1 into susceptible varieties increases resistance comparable to resistant varieties, for which the leucine-rich repeat domain is critical for recognizing root-knot nematode invasion. We also report transcriptome and cytological changes that are correlated with a rapid and robust response during the incompatible interaction that occurs in resistant rice upon nematode invasion. Furthermore, we identified a putative protease inhibitor that directly interacts with MG1 during MG1-mediated resistance. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis of nematode resistance as well as valuable resources for developing rice varieties with improved nematode resistance.
