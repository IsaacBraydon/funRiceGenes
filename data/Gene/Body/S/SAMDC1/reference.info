nrs_2007_page_001.pdf	The effects of genetic manipulation of putrescine biosynthesis on transcription and activities of the other polyamine biosynthetic enzymes	2007	Physiologia Plantarum	Department of Plant Biology, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824, USA	We have studied the effects of overproduction of putrescine (Put) via transgenic expression of a mouse ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene on the expression of native genes for four enzymes involved in polyamine biosynthesis in hybrid poplar (Populus nigra√ómaximowiczii) cells. An examination of the transcript levels of arginine decarboxylase (ADC), ODC, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) and spermidine synthase (SPDS), as well as their enzyme activities (except SPDS), showed that the expression of different members of the SAMDC and SPDS gene families was affected differently in response to alteration of the cellular Put content. It was further observed that there was a strong correlation between transcript levels and the activity of the respective enzyme in the cells. Moreover, there was no feedback inhibition of the expression of the native ODC or the ADC genes or their enzyme activities by increased Put in the cells.
Yamaguchi-2004-cDNA microarray anal.pdf	cDNA Microarray Analysis of Rice Anther Genes under Chilling Stress at the Microsporogenesis Stage Revealed Two Genes with DNA TransposonCastawayin the 5'-Flanking Region	2014	Bioscience, Biotechnology and Biochemistry	Plant Physiology Laboratory, National Agricultural Research Center for Tohoku Region 2) Department of Molecular Genetics, National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences	Rice is most chilling sensitive at the onset of microspore release. Chilling treatment at this stage causes male sterility. The gene expression profile during the microspore development process under chilling stress was revealed using a microarray that included 8,987 rice cDNAs. As many as 160 cDNAs were up- or down-regulated by chilling during the microspore release stage. RT-PCR analysis of 5 genes confirmed the microarray results. We identified 3 novel genes whose expression levels were remarkably changed by chilling in rice anther. A new cis element that includes a DNA transposon Castaway sequence was found in the 5' upstream region of two genes which were conspicuously down-regulated by chilling temperatures in rice anther.
