Kamiya-2003-The SCARECROW gene's.pdf	TheSCARECROWgene's role in asymmetric cell divisions in rice plants	2003	The Plant Journal	BioScience Center, Nagoya University, Chikusa, Nagoya 464-8601, Japan,	Asymmetric cell division is one of the most important mechanisms in the diversification of cell function and fate. In Arabidopsis, SCARECROW (SCR) is essential for the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell in the root. To learn more about how SCR is involved in asymmetric division, we analyzed the rice SCR (OsSCR) expression. In the root tip, OsSCR expression was observed in the endodermal cell layer and downregulated in the daughter cortex cell after asymmetric division, just as with Arabidopsis SCR. In leaf primordia, expression of OsSCR was observed in stomatal and ligule formation. In stomatal development, OsSCR was specifically expressed in the stomatal cell files before formation of guard mother cells (GMCs), and then, its expression was localized in GMCs, when the first asymmetric division occurred to generate the GMCs. Before the second asymmetric division of subsidiary mother cells (SMCs), localized OsSCR expression was observed in SMCs in the area close to the GMCs. Before these asymmetric divisions, the localization of OsSCR mRNA in GMC-forming cells and SMCs was observed in the area of the daughter GMC and subsidiary cells. OsSCR expression was also observed in the initiation area of ligule formation, and its downregulation occurred in the inner L2 cells generated by asymmetric division. Based on these observations, we proposed that OsSCR is involved not only in the asymmetric division of the cortex/endodermis progenitor cell but also during stomata and ligule formation by establishing the polarization of cytoplasm.
NA	SHR overexpression induces the formation of supernumerary cell layers with cortex cell identity in rice.	2017	Dev Biol	CIRAD, UMR AGAP, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5 France.	The number of root cortex cell layers varies among plants, and many species have several cortical cell layers. We recently demonstrated that the two rice orthologs of the Arabidopsis SHR gene, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2, could complement the A. thaliana shr mutant. Moreover, OsSHR1 and OsSHR2 expression in A. thaliana roots induced the formation of extra root cortical cell layers. In this article, we demonstrate that the overexpression of AtSHR and OsSHR2 in rice roots leads to plants with wide and short roots that contain a high number of extra cortical cell layers. We hypothesize that SHR genes may share a conserved function in the control of cortical cell layer division and the number of ground tissue cell layers in land plants.
NA	Multiple transcriptional factors control stomata development in rice.	2019	New Phytol	MOE Key Laboratory of Cell Activities and Stress Adaptations, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China.	The grass stomata can balance the gas exchange and evaporation effectively in rapidly changing environment via their unique anatomical features. Although the key components of stomatal development in Arabidopsis have been largely elucidated during the past decade, the molecular mechanisms that govern stomatal development in grasses are poorly understood. Via the genome editing system and T-DNA insertion lines, the key transcriptional factors (TFs) regulating stomatal development in rice (Oryza sativa) were knocked out. A combination of genetic and biochemical assays subsequently revealed the functions of these TFs. OsSPCH/OsICE is essential for the initiation of stomatal lineage. OsMUTE/OsICE determines meristemoid to guard mother cell (GMC) transition. OsFAMA/OsICE influences subsidiary mother cell asymmetric division and mature stoma differentiation. OsFLP regulates the orientation of GMC symmetric division. More importantly, we found that OsSCR/OsSHR controls the initiation of stomatal lineage cells and the formation of subsidiary cells, and the transcription of OsSCR is activated by OsSPCH and OsMUTE. This study characterized the functions of master regulatory TFs that control each stomatal developmental stage in rice. Our findings are helpful to elucidate how various species reprogramme the molecular mechanisms to generate different stomatal types during evolution. This article is protected by copyright.

NA	Genome-Wide Identification, Transcript Profiling and Bioinformatic Analyses of GRAS Transcription Factor Genes in Rice.	2021	Front Plant Sci	Department of Plant Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India.	Our group has previously identified the activation of a GRAS transcription factor (TF) gene in the gain-of-function mutant population developed through activation tagging in rice (in an indica rice variety, BPT 5204) that was screened for water use efficiency. This family of GRAS transcription factors has been well known for their diverse roles in gibberellin signaling, light responses, root development, gametogenesis etc. Recent studies indicated their role in biotic and abiotic responses as well. Although this family of TFs received significant attention, not many genes were identified specifically for their roles in mediating stress tolerance in rice. Only OsGRAS23 (here named as OsGRAS22) was reported to code for a TF that induced drought tolerance in rice. In the present study, we have analyzed the expression patterns of rice GRAS TF genes under abiotic (NaCl and ABA treatments) and biotic (leaf samples infected with pathogens, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae that causes bacterial leaf blight and Rhizoctonia solani that causes sheath blight) stress conditions. In addition, their expression patterns were also analyzed in 13 different developmental stages. We studied their spatio-temporal regulation and correlated them with the in-silico studies. Fully annotated genomic sequences available in rice database have enabled us to study the protein properties, ligand interactions, domain analysis and presence of cis-regulatory elements through the bioinformatic approach. Most of the genes were induced immediately after the onset of stress particularly in the roots of ABA treated plants. OsGRAS39 was found to be a highly expressive gene under sheath blight infection and both abiotic stress treatments while OsGRAS8, OsSHR1 and OsSLR1 were also responsive. Our earlier activation tagging based functional characterization followed by the genome-wide characterization of the GRAS gene family members in the present study clearly show that they are highly appropriate candidate genes for manipulating stress tolerance in rice and other crop plants.
NA	SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW homologs regulate patterning of diverse cell types within and between species.	2022	New Phytol	Department of Plant Biology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, 95616, USA.	The roles of SHORT-ROOT (SHR) and SCARECROW (SCR) in ground tissue patterning and differentiation have been well established in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana. Recently, work in additional organs and species revealed the extensive functional diversification of these genes, including regulation of cortical divisions essential for nodule organogenesis in legume roots, bundle sheath specification in the Arabidopsis leaf, patterning of inner leaf cell layers in maize, and stomatal development in rice. The co-option of distinct functions and cell types is attributed to different mechanisms, including paralog retention, spatiotemporal changes in gene expression, and novel protein functions. Elaborating our knowledge of the SHR-SCR module further unravels the developmental regulation that controls diverse forms and functions within and between species.
NA	SHORT ROOT and INDETERMINATE DOMAIN family members govern PIN-FORMED expression to regulate minor vein differentiation in rice.	2023	Plant Cell	Biotechnology Research Institute (BRI), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Beijing, China.	C3 and C4 grasses directly and indirectly provide the vast majority of calories to the human diet, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving photosynthetic productivity in grasses is largely unexplored. Ground meristem cells divide to form mesophyll or vascular initial cells early in leaf development in C3 and C4 grasses. Here we define a genetic circuit composed of SHR (SHORT ROOT), IDD (INDETERMINATE DOMAIN), and PIN (PIN-FORMED) family members that specifies vascular identify and ground cell proliferation in leaves of both C3 and C4 grasses. Ectopic expression and loss-of-function mutant studies of SHR paralogs in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) and the C4 plant Setaria viridis (green millet) revealed the roles of these genes in both minor vein formation and ground cell differentiation. Genetic and in vitro studies further suggested that SHR regulates this process through its interactions with IDD12 and 13. We also revealed direct interactions of these IDD proteins with a putative regulatory element within the auxin transporter gene PIN5c. Collectively, these findings indicate that a SHR-IDD regulatory circuit mediates auxin transport by negatively regulating PIN expression to modulate minor vein patterning in the grasses.
