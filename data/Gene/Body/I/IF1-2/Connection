IF1-1	IF1-2	Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria	 A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two IF 1 genes and the amino acid sequence of the mature IF1 protein from potato revealed that IF1-1 and IF1-2 have N-terminal extensions with features that are characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting signal| To determine the subcellular localization of the gene products, the IF1-1 or IF1-2 proteins were fused in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the fused GFP-Î²-glucuronidase, and expressed transiently in onion or dayflower epidermal cells
