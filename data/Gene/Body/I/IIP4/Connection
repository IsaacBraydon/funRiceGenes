IIP4	ILA1	An uncanonical CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein represses secondary wall synthesis and controls mechanical strength in rice.	 Here, we report that ILA1 interacting protein 4 (IIP4) can repress secondary wall synthesis
IIP4	MYB61|OsMYB61	An uncanonical CCCH-tandem zinc finger protein represses secondary wall synthesis and controls mechanical strength in rice.	 Gene expression and transactivation activity assays revealed that IIP4 negatively regulates expression of MYB61 and CESAs without binding to the promoters of these genes
