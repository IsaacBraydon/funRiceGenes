ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	defense	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization

ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	 sa 	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	SA	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
