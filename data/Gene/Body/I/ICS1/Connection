ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 OsWRKY6 directly bound to the OsICS1 promoter inÂ vivo
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	 This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
