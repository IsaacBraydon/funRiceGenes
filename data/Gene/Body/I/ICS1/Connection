ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	OsWRKY6 directly bound to the OsICS1 promoter inÂ vivo
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsWRKY6	Molecular characterization of Oryza sativa WRKY6, which binds to W-box-like element 1 of the Oryza sativa pathogenesis-related (PR) 10a promoter and confers reduced susceptibility to pathogens.	Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 A yeast two-hybrid screen revealed an interaction between OsUEV1B and OsVDAC1, which was confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and firefly split-luciferase complementation assays
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Under sufficient Pi conditions, similar to osuev1b, a mutation in OsVDAC1 resulted in significantly greater Pi concentrations in the roots and second leaves, improved acid phosphatase activity, and enhanced expression of the Pi starvation inducible and phosphate transporter genes compared with wild-type DongJin, whereas overexpression of OsVDAC1 had the opposite effects
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 OsUEV1B or OsVDAC1 knockout reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate levels
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsUEV1B	OsUEV1B, an Ubc enzyme variant protein, is required for phosphate homeostasis in rice.	 Moreover, overexpression of OsVDAC1 in osuev1b partially restored its high Pi concentration to a level between those of osuev1b and DongJin
ICS1|OsVDAC1|OsICS1	OsSFR6|OsMED16	OsMED16, a tail subunit of ediator complex, interacts with OsE2Fa to synergistically regulate rice leaf development and blast resistance.	 Further analysis revealed that OsMED16 interacts with OsE2Fa in nuclei, and the complex could directly regulate the transcriptional levels of several genes involved in cell cycle regulation and SA mediated blast resistance, such as OsCC52A1, OsCDKA1, OsCDKB2;2, OsICS1 and OsWRKY45
