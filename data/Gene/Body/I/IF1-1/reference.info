Nakazono-2000-Characterization of.pdf	Characterization of two cDNA clones encoding isozymes of the F1F0-ATPase inhibitor protein of rice mitochondria	2000	Planta	Laboratory of Plant Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan, JP	Two cDNA clones encoding F1F0-ATPase inhibitor proteins, which are loosely associated with the F1 part of the mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase, were characterized from rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare). A Northern hybridization showed that the two genes (designated as IF 1 -1 and IF 1 -2) are transcribed in all the organs examined. However, the steady-state mRNA levels varied among organs. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the two IF 1 genes and the amino acid sequence of the mature IF1 protein from potato revealed that IF1-1 and IF1-2 have N-terminal extensions with features that are characteristic of a mitochondrial targeting signal. To determine the subcellular localization of the gene products, the IF1-1 or IF1-2 proteins were fused in frame to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the fused GFP-Î²-glucuronidase, and expressed transiently in onion or dayflower epidermal cells. Localized fluorescence was detected in mitochondria, confirming that the two IF1 proteins are targeted to mitochondria.
